AlGore_2009-0001304-0002346 last year i showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower forty eight states has shrunk by forty percent
AlGore_2009-0011068-0011830 she's okay the question is whether we will be and one reason is this enormous heat sink heats up greenland from the north
AlGore_2009-0020516-0020955 what this is doing
AlGore_2009-0033881-0034242 the fact is coal isn't dirty we think it's clean
AlGore_2009-0040921-0041490 finally a solution that's big enough to solve our problems repower america find out more
AlGore_2009-0043770-0044092 new investments to create high paying jobs
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001224-0001955 i'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things you've already heard and i'll try to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0009855-0010532 i want to say just a word about salad dressing a hundred and seventy five salad dressings in my supermarket if you don't count
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0019251-0020164 and do you know what the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much so
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0029108-0030333 is meant to indicate we get to we don't inherit an identity we get to invent it and we get to re invent ourselves as often as we like and that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036516-0037766 we are blessed as carl was pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the randolph hotel
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0045623-0046263 is this good news or bad news and the answer is yes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0055420-0056869 by not participating they are passing up as much as five thousand dollars a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices and i think it makes the world look like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0065517-0066069 that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen here is an example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0074419-0075648 and you bought them and they fit like crap and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times they started to feel feel ok so i went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones and i said i
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0084041-0085502 can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be and what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results even when they're good results nobody in the world of marketing knows this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0094116-0095401 when there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available and you buy one that is disappointing and you ask why who's responsible it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0103651-0104500 in industrial societies is material affluence there are lots of places in the world and we have heard about several of them
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0112295-0113151 impoverished imagination a myopic view of the world and that's the way i read it at first the more i thought about it however the more i came to the view that this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0114308-0115008 if you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible you decrease satisfaction
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0001220-0001572 what i'm going to show you first as quickly as i can is
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0008335-0009847 maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e book i wouldn't recommend it this is a more realistic case this is an issue of the guardian every large image is the beginning of a section and this really gives you the the the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0018272-0019697 but but the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful the computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these these shots all taken near grassi lakes in the canadian rockies
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0029457-0029856 so many of them are occluded by faces and and so on
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0038071-0038867 collected not just from from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on but from the collective memory thank you so much
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0041420-0041924 yes what this is really doing is discovering it's creating hyperlinks if you will between between images
BrianCox_2009U-0001316-0002336 last year at ted i gave an introduction to the lhc and i promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine works so this is it and for those of you who weren't there the lhc is
BrianCox_2009U-0009054-0010347 related actually to these bits of wire here these gold wires those wires carry thirteen thousand amps when the machine is working in full power now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say no they don't they're small wires
BrianCox_2009U-0017422-0019378 i will leave the final word to an english scientist humphrey davy who i suspect when defending his protege's useless experiments his protege was michael faraday said this nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate
CraigVenter_2008-0001566-0003143 you know i've talked about some of these projects before about the human genome and what that might mean and discovering new sets of genes we're actually starting at a new point we've been digitizing biology
CraigVenter_2008-0009425-0010453 we're able to knock out on the order of a hundred genes out of the five hundred or so that are here but when we look at its metabolic map it's relatively simple
CraigVenter_2008-0018916-0019962 and it's a degenerate process so the longer you make the piece the more errors there are so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors
CraigVenter_2008-0025927-0027295 it's over five hundred and eighty thousand letters of genetic code so we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are
CraigVenter_2008-0035697-0037646 fit those together to make twenty four thousand letter pieces then put sets of those going up to seventy two thousand at each stage we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust that you can see in a minute we're trying to get to the point of automation
CraigVenter_2008-0042736-0044886 i am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space move around find a new aqueous environment in fact nasa has shown a lot of this is out there here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in
CraigVenter_2008-0052819-0054403 we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell and you'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here
CraigVenter_2008-0062453-0063267 dramatically now i've argued this is not genesis this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution
CraigVenter_2008-0069935-0071011 we now from our discovery around the world have a database with about twenty million genes and i like to think of these as the design components of the future
CraigVenter_2008-0077996-0079101 you know we don't know necessarily what it'll look like we know exactly what their genetic code looks like we're focusing on now fourth generation fuels
CraigVenter_2008-0088800-0089132 yeah if you can't do that at ted where can you
CraigVenter_2008-0090711-0091286 i think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance
DavidMerrill_2009-0001148-0002562 i want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid playing with blocks as you figured out how to reach out and grasp pick them up and move them around you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships
DavidMerrill_2009-0010729-0011659 if they get surrounded they notice that too they might get a little flustered and they can also sense their motion and tilt
DavidMerrill_2009-0021216-0021563 that's our youngest beta tester down there on the right
DavidMerrill_2009-0030464-0031572 and you inject it by just bumping up the sound siftable against a sequence siftable there are effects that you can control live like reverb and filter you attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0001280-0002715 i am a writer writing books is my profession but it's more than that of course it is also my great lifelong love and fascination and i don't expect that that's ever going to change but that said
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0011233-0011564 like that you know and a a the answer
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0018718-0020202 we writers you know we kind of do have that reputation and not not just writers but creative people across all genres it seems have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable and you know all you have to do is look at the very grim
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0026962-0028749 you know and i and i i definitely know that in in my case in my situation it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption you know particularly given the circumstance that i'm in right now in my career which is you know
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0036273-0037578 better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of of creativity and that search has led me to ancient greece and ancient rome
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0044882-0045575 right so the ancient artist was protected from certain things like for example too much narcissism right if your work was brilliant
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0053607-0054348 has been killing off our artists for the last five hundred years and if this is true and i i think it is true
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0061061-0062915 paranormal i had this encounter recently where i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone who's now in her nineties but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virginia she would be out working in the fields and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0071604-0073114 it's not at all my creative process i'm not the pipeline you know like i'm a mule and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day and like sweat and labor and like barrel through it really awkwardly but even i in my mulishness even i have brushed up against that thing
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0081176-0081847 completely novel he just looked up at the sky and he said excuse me can you not see that i'm driving
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0088499-0090524 not just bad but the worst book ever written and and i started to think i should just dump this project you know but then i remembered tom talking to the open air and i i i tried it so i just lifted my face up from the manuscript and i directed my comments to an empty corner of the room and i i said aloud listen you thing
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0097660-0099526 and all of a sudden he would no longer appear to be merely human you know he would be like lit from within and lit from below and all like lit up on fire with divinity and when this happened back then people knew it for what it was you know they called it by it's name they would put their hands together and they would start to chant
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0106099-0108280 you know but maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe in the first place that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you but maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you you know from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished with somebody else
ElizabethGilbert_2009-0111240-0112572 continue to show up for your piece of it whatever that might be if your job is to dance do your dance if the divine cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed
WadeDavis_2003-0001251-0003452 you know one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways who still feel their past in the wind touch it in stones polished by rain taste it in the bitter leaves of plants just to know that jaguar shamans still journey beyond the milky way or the

WadeDavis_2003-0019241-0021422 there were six thousand languages spoken on the planet now a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules a language is a flash of the human spirit it's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world every language is an old growth forest of the mind a watershed a thought an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities
WadeDavis_2003-0027861-0028558 now there are many of us who sort of
WadeDavis_2003-0036073-0038778 tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure found nothing and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil so they speared the five missionaries to death but the waorani didn't just spear outsiders they speared each other fifty four percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other we traced genealogies back eight generations and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old so we speared him anyway
WadeDavis_2003-0046338-0047422 you white people go to church and speak about god we dance in the temple and become god and because you are possessed you are taken by the spirit how can you be harmed so you see these astonishing
WadeDavis_2003-0053944-0056945 are inculturated into the values of their society values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic or we might say the ecological balance and at the end of this amazing initiation one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives at the age of eighteen they see a sunrise and in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory
WadeDavis_2003-0063917-0065973 resource or that place than a young kid from montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant what's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world i was raised in the forests of british columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut
WadeDavis_2003-0071736-0073158 leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called psychotria viridis this plant has in it some very powerful tryptamines very close to brain serotonin dimethyltryptamine five methoxydimethyltryptamine if you've ever seen the yanomami
WadeDavis_2003-0080643-0083271 morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts well we use that great euphemism trial and error which is exposed to be meaningless but you ask the indians and they say the plants talk to us well what does that mean this tribe the cofan has seventeen varieties of ayahuasca all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest all of which are referable to our eye
WadeDavis_2003-0088524-0090661 all cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a in a dance with new possibilities of life and the problem is not technology itself the sioux indians did not stop being sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an american stopped being an american when he gave up the horse and buggy it's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere it is power

WadeDavis_2003-0105433-0106921 margaret mead the great anthropologist said before she died that her greatest fear that was was as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow and

WadeDavis_2003-0123088-0124224 and finally in the end i think it's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who've travelled in these remote reaches of the planet to realize that they're not remote at all they're homelands of somebody
WadeDavis_2003-0126654-0127480 are not persuasive but we think that storytelling can change the world and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world we get thirty five million
