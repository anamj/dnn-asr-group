AlGore_2009-0002346-0004004 but this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice the arctic icecap is in a sense of the beating heart of the global climate system because that's where the democrats things about the next slide show you will be

AlGore_2009-0006260-0006905 in twenty five years it's all numbers suggest this is a problem because the warming

AlGore_2009-0012659-0013511 we wanted to know how sea level rises on land based ice melting this is where everything is also increasing rapidly

AlGore_2009-0015409-0016856 the minimalist rewards maximize at the top you see you later with a few years ago glaciers we personable people in the world after drinking water from the melting pot in the andes this glacier is a source of drinking water for the city 
AlGore_2009-0016856-0018678 the flows of increase but when they go away so that much of the drinking water in california there's the four percent decline in the sierra snowpack assisting reservoirs and productions into bread or serious is trying to round the world has led to a dramatic increase in force 
AlGore_2009-0018678-0020516 and the disastrous around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary an unprecedented rate or congressmen in the last three years as in the previous seventy five this is a completely unsustainable and if you look at in the context of history you can see 
AlGore_2009-0020516-0020955 what the system 
AlGore_2009-0020955-0021791 in the last five years without a seventy million tons of c o two every twenty four hours with a billion times every day to the oceans 
AlGore_2009-0021791-0022916 look carefully at the revenues from the survey from the americas extending westwood and on either side of the indian subcontinent brothers they went to the police department in the oceans 
AlGore_2009-0022916-0023668 the biggest single cause of global warming along with deforestation which is what percentage of the burning of fossil fuels all the product 
AlGore_2009-0023668-0025415 and call this the most serious problem the united states is one of the two largest emitters on top and a proposal has been to build a lot more complex but we're beginning to see a sea change are the ones that have been tested in the last two years with the green alternatives to perform 
AlGore_2009-0025415-0027030 however there is a political battle in our country and coal industries and enormous respect for the building for the last hundred years promoting we call which is an oxymoron that image reminded me of something

AlGore_2009-0032607-0033881 she worried you climate change is a very serious threat to world as much as we made our primary goals and a large sum of money online advertising efforts to promote and complicated things about goals 
AlGore_2009-0033881-0034242 but it is crucial to deal with it 
AlGore_2009-0034336-0034477 so stay tuned 
AlGore_2009-0034538-0035003 so don't worry about climate change and these animals

AlGore_2009-0043195-0043622 over here with some of the new emerging markets 
AlGore_2009-0043770-0044092 users industrialized nations 
AlGore_2009-0044281-0044591 we found an integral 
AlGore_2009-0044591-0045669 there's an old african proverb that says if you would look what we call it would afford altogether we need to go for quickly 
AlGore_2009-0045669-0045797 the government 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001224-0001955 talk about them so that in his book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things that you've already heard about china 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001955-0002689 making connections myself in case you missed them will start with what i call the official 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0002689-0003874 if you don't want efficient all western industrial societies inefficient morons like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0003874-0004912 the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0004912-0006224 the new ball worthwhile essential to be human and because of people have freedom that each of us come back tomorrow to do things to maximize welfare workers to decide on their behalf 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0006224-0007545 the way to maximize freedom is to maximise towards the more choice people have more freedom they have more freedom they have them all over the world 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0007545-0008962 this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that would encourage anyone depression and it also deeply embedded in our lives 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0008962-0009855 give you some examples of what modern progress has been made possible for us this is my supermarket that such a big one 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0009855-0010532 or assailants were not surprising or seventy five celebrations in a supermarket you don't count 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0010532-0011842 but in fact a virtual worlds and local semiconductors you combine to make a very large numbers are also addresses the off chance that the other seventy five store has to offer changes 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0011842-0012947 so this is what the shooter games like many other consumer electronics or senator stereo system speaker cd player tape player rapid fire in his work 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0012947-0013956 single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0013956-0015043 the french resistance and of course the drama from one story began to watch lists and other domains the world global communications 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0015043-0016393 there was a time when i was a boy when you can get any kind of water shortages was came from about your at age forty gigabyte or consequences that by the way this before never broke and so 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0016393-0017265 but this time we now have an almost unlimited variety of forms especially the world cellphones user cellphones in the future 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0017265-0017960 but there's a minority mp three player knows her children properly torch added 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0018189-0019251 if i suggest you haven't seen many years forget you can rest assured that one day she knew well what is that these people talking to their scores asking this question 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0019251-0020164 and you know the answer to this question now is the answer is no it's not possible to myself a little bit too much so 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0020164-0021506 in other aspects of life in a much more significant than buying things the same sort of choices for healthcare is more vacation united states thank you 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0021506-0022404 but the doctrine of that tells you what to expect that the doctor to doctor tells you a weekend away we can do the same as these benefits 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0022404-0023325 any risks because these benefits and risks we wanted to michigan which i do in the boxes 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0023325-0024559 they have these benefits and risks and because these benefits risks when you what do you say if you worry about what would you do the boxes barack obama 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0024559-0026795 and resources we caucasians autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing when religious shifting of government responsible for decision making and somebody you know something they wurzelbacher somebody who knows nothing of the culturally sixpences on the best they can be making decisions made by the patient now there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0026795-0028208 people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense last weekend i know when the market was affected by then the answer is that it's better support for the next morning and ask for politicians to be changed 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0028208-0029108 something as dramatic as our identity is now become a matter of choice now this slide 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0029108-0030333 is that you were convicted we get away with her identity we get one that we get reinvent ourselves as often as we like an amazing every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030333-0030923 you will be an encounter with respect to marriage and family 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030923-0032176 there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone has to be the various initiatives and you start having physicians you turn up the only real choice was cool 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0032176-0033102 darwin and that when you do that nowadays everything is very much a threat to teach wonderfully intelligence students 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0033102-0034166 and so i assign twenty percent which would provide issue is that because there was worse to stop because there was a legend it's because they are preoccupied 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034166-0034940 asking themselves should i get married or not to get carried out within hours later she might have to search for truth hurts 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034940-0036185 all these are consuming passion and dedication these questions whether or not it means that we all work by simon boccanegra workforce and indeed they should be shared with questions to answer 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036404-0036516 work 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036516-0037766 we are blessed squirrels pointed out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from a place on the planet except the remote control 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0038294-0039241 there is one quarter by the way the amount of time by labour you actually rather proudly hiawatha works but i knew that we're using them 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0039241-0040156 so what this means is incredible freedom of choice reactors that work is that we have to make decisions again and again and again about whether 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0040156-0041465 we should or shouldn't be working within which are simply shorter than we ever so for a woman and a black bear market there's a laptop personally artworks even the auction off 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0041465-0042097 every network articulate soccer game we are also less your social activists 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0042097-0043255 so far cautious optimism oceanographers whether anybody asked the question is no external avoid making serious americans are in very different languages 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0043255-0044538 so everywhere we look on the basis of small things that are all things a little things like is a matter of choice and will use all of them look like this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0044742-0045623 that is to say the word socialism and everything was a matter of choice in the world without leaving looks like this and the question is 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0045623-0046263 this is good news bad news and the answer is yes 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0046554-0047602 we all know what's good about trying to talk about what they're about all this choice has two facts to begin with executed 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0047602-0048920 what effect paradoxically centrifuges promises rather than a brush with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult issues at all 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0048920-0050062 i'll give you one very dramatic example of this study that was an overall investment in our voluntary retirement was a colleague of mine got access to 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0050177-0051115 the best records from before this gigantic often probably about a million employees about two thousand for work which is what she found is that 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051115-0051894 for creating mutual funds that were offered with participation went down two percent 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051894-0054066 your for fifty pounds ten percent fewer employees participate if you will to fight why because with fifty five stitches chromosome they're hard to decide which one to choose and you just awful tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course the participants 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0054066-0055420 understand that not only does this mean that you've already got one their party doesn't have enough money to work it also means that made the decision so hard to pass up significant economic framing store 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0055420-0056869 i'm not participating they're passionate as much as five thousand dollars in your family or would happily better product to process is a consequence of having too many choices anything that makes the world look like this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0057498-0058253 you really were made that decision right in detroit really right you know what the provision for the broad shoulders 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0058253-0059016 so that within sight of the fact is that even if we manage to overcome the process and make choices 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0059016-0060008 windows were satisfied with the results of the choice we would be if we have fewer options situation for several reasons 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0060008-0061247 one of them is that a lot of difference addresses issues from if you bought one is not perfect and whatsoever says it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice would be better 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0061247-0062516 and what happens is this imagined alternative and insecurity decision you make a different structure dissatisfaction you get better decision making it was a decision 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0062516-0063239 the more options are forty years or write anything at all was disappointed about architecture 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0063239-0064442 second what economists call opportunity cost the government and the quickest way of talking about how how much over the way in which we find things that is what we compare them to 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0064442-0065375 well what are lots of alternatives to consider is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternative venue reject 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0065517-0066069 and that maybe you were satisfied with the alternative that shows you some examples 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066069-0066421 for those of you on your side pocket 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066421-0067741 but it was supposed to be thinking irresistible on manhattan's very expensive real estate or just each beautiful they may have also themselves what could be better well there because i think it's august 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0067741-0068445 everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is the way i can keep working right in front of my goal 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0068445-0069441 he spent two weeks made by the idea that is missing the opportunity today after they'd have a great purpose 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0069441-0070466 opportunity cost structure dissatisfaction with inadequate we choose even when we choose a church and more options there are considered 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0070466-0071150 the more attractive features of these options for would be reflected biases opportunity cost is another trap 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0071609-0072731 however despite initial appointed exploitable living in the moment as well and probably about giving slowly but once pointed mexico where you're choosing one opinion 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0072731-0073478 choosing not to do other things and those are the things that are quite attractive features is the ability to western world 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0073478-0074419 escalation of expectations basically when i went to replace my genes which is also time and was twenty seven one flavor 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0074419-0075648 the new ball or anything like that they're incredibly uncomfortable if you were one of the worst of the different things you will pay someone to replace wages and years and years of work is always anti-semite 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0075648-0077665 the border to synthesize the shopkeeper said you want something easy thing to realize that you will acquire shepherds why he was so widespread support you want to stress you can copy what the problem with my jaw dropped after crisis what crimes they used to be your car 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078109-0078372 he had no idea what that was 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078372-0079678 so i said well we're trying to always think she's a network of supporters with the best thing she said whatever and i'd be better all his choice made it possible for me to do better 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0079678-0080552 but i felt which while overall book to try to squeeze to myself 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0080992-0082076 the reason i felt forces there will always options available my expectations about how to repair changing the way up 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0082076-0083475 i had very little to no particular expectations for the weekend once we were working together flavors that a woman should understand why there was good but wasn't perfect and so i compare what i got all excited 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0083475-0084041 when i got was disappointing that wasn't what i expected any options to people's lives 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0084041-0085502 it hopes to increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be aware that contributions were satisfied with what results the weather conditions nobody in the world of marketing noses 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085502-0085781 but if they did 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085781-0086326 you will notice was about the truth is more like this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0086674-0087775 the reason that everything was better than when everything was worse is that when everything was of course it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were present products 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0087775-0088887 nowadays the world we live in a way that would industrialize citizens with perfection expectation the best you can ever hope for is that as the position you expected 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0088887-0090231 you'll never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations were expectations about the group the secret to happiness as we're talking for synthetic happiness is low expectations 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0091167-0092769 i would say just one of them will fire at the moment that i actually rather too wide and which is really quite wonderful i could have done better in itself but so is the most vexing problem 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0092769-0094116 one consequence of beiderbecke anchorages when there's only one kind of like is that when you were dissatisfied and was widely as possible this rescue the world's shows what would you do 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0094116-0095401 when there are hundreds of diversity is available and you by one that's disappointing u.s. wireless as possible is equally if we are to be asked the question is you 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0095401-0096794 you could have done better with about one hundred different ideas on display there's no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even more voters also decisions for what they feel disappointed 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0096794-0099151 about out between themselves clinical depression has exploded in industry worldwide generation everyday significant calculated a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experience as disappointing as educators is alive and then what happens when the disgraced themselves they think they are at fault 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099151-0099870 and so the net result is that we do better temple in general objectively we feel worse 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099870-0100615 so let me remind you this is the official forum where we all pay to be true 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0100615-0101431 it all falls is not true there's no question that some choices entertainment 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0101431-0102631 but it doesn't format and more choices better than some chose this a medical marijuana is utterly confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0102631-0103651 well for now is a policy marathon is a policy that are the thing to think about is what enables all this choice 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0103651-0104500 the biggest societies is that your levels there are lots of places in the world we've heard about several of them 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0104500-0105476 well the problem is not that they have too much choice their problems that they have trouble so this i'm talking about is the peculiar problem either 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0105483-0106567 at ford western societies was so frustrated during this is the one that got yesterday about how expensive and difficult ones so 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0106690-0107078 his constituency both hope 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0107078-0108308 it's a waste of money what i'm telling you is that these expensive complicated choices is not simply the tabletop that we heard that we may get worse 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0108308-0109445 or if someone makes people in our societies today on the choices we make we're shifted to societies in which people have too few options 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0109445-0110503 now one of those people i speak truth to power could be improved also is what economists call prego improving low income redistribution will make everyone 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0110503-0111279 there was just forty because of the homeless registers points so to conclude 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0111279-0112192 this country this cartoon and a sophisticated person say what is essential to know that it is possible that before 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0112295-0113151 impoverished imagination myopic view the world that's where the first with obama however the more i came to the view that is 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0113151-0114308 this notion that the truth of the matter is that if you share a fishbowl so that anything is possible you have freedom you have grounds 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0114308-0115008 if you share this is also that everything is possible you decrease satisfaction 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115008-0115842 you increase paralysis and decrease satisfaction everybody's official this one is culturally two women 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115842-0116905 perhaps even further fish germany france and the absence of some of the forty fourth recipe for misery and i suspect that thank you very much 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0001220-0001572 especially for services to san francisco 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0001572-0002425 this is a foundation for science and technology the deliberate microscopes proposition opens up your goal but this is the driving 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0002425-0004061 and it's in partnership environment we are more interactive vast amounts of the virtual world in many many gigabytes of competition photosynthesis in seamlessly into the criticism in an interesting ratio between us and them 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0004061-0005460 it doesn't matter how much information with all these discussions are or how these images are animals that are very difficult for citizen is of course a self-employed recovers and southern africa but his life
