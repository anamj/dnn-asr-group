BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001955-0002689 make some connections myself in case you december will start with what i call the official ball 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0002689-0003874 if you bought ofwat efficient all all for western industrial societies any official dorrance like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0003874-0004912 the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself goods 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0004912-0006224 thou new ball worthwhile essential to be human and because if people have freedom then each of us can act borrowed to do the things that all maximize our welfare no one has to decide on our behalf 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0006224-0007545 the way to maximise freedom is to maximise chores the more choice people have the more freedom they have and more freedom they have the more will further have 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0007545-0008962 this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that wouldn't occur to anyone to question it and it also deeply embedded in our lives 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0008962-0009855 give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us this is my supermarket but such a big one 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0009855-0010532 or assailants were about sow addressing oliver seventy five soccer season was supermarket if you don't count

BarrySchwartz_2005G-0015043-0016393 there was a time when i was a boy when you can get any control for search you want the swiss came from although you wreckage are forbidden by one consequence of that by the way is that before never broke and rome 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0016393-0017265 those days are god we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially the world cellphones these are cellphones in the future 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0017265-0017960 my favorite is the minority mp three player noshir caring for elderly torch added 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0018189-0019251 if by some chance you haven't seen added years forget you can rest assured that one day shoot you woke with his thousands of these people talking to their scores asking this question 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0019251-0020164 and you know the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to buy soulful that goes into too much so 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0020164-0021506 in other aspects of life in a much more significant than now buying things the same topics portion of choice is true in health care is more vacation interstates thank you 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0021506-0022404 or the doctrine of that tells you what to do instead you go to the doctor in the market shows you a weekend away all we can do the same as these benefits 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0022404-0023325 and each risks the huskies benefits and age risks what you wanted to finish a box which i do in the boxes 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0023325-0024559 they have these benefits and risks and he has these benefits risks when you want to <unk> and you say if you were we got what would you do the boxers but are not me 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0024559-0026795 and the result is we call patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing when really uses a shifting of the bird numbers possibly for decision making from somebody you know something they wurzelbacher somebody who knows nothing of the summit shirley sick and the sun the best shape to be making decisions mainly the patient now there's enormous more coming of protection drugs 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0026795-0028208 the people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense last weekend either one of them or to tell us if we can't buy them the answer is that dates back to score doctors the next morning and ask for politicians to be changed 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0028208-0029108 something as dramatic as our identity is now become a matter of choice now this slide 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0029108-0030333 is that you were convicted we get you will inherit identity we get we've ended we get reinvent ourselves as often as we like an amazing every day when you wake up in the morning you get to the sidewalk or person 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030333-0030923 you will be on in our with respect to marriage and family 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030923-0032176 there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone has is that you get married she knew she could and you start having physicians you turn up the only real choice was cool 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0032176-0033102 but when <unk> and that we needed after nowadays everything is very much up for grabs i teach wonderfully intelligence tunes 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0033102-0034166 and though i assign twenty percent westwood n.i.u. shoe it's not because there was worse to stop because there was diligence it's because they are preoccupied 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034166-0034940 asking themselves should i get married or not she may get married now shy to marry later she might have kids for cirque or your first 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034940-0036185 all these four consuming freshness and are natasha these questions whether or not it means that we all work irish i'm not getting the brain of my courses and indeed they should be served four questions to answer 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036404-0036516 work 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036516-0037766 we are blessed us corals pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the rental hotel 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0038294-0039241 there is one quarter by the way the market highbury about or you've actually brother were the high quantify works but i knew that i will use it on 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0039241-0040156 so what this means is incredible freedom of choice we have offers that work is that we have to make decisions again and again and again about whether 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0040156-0041465 we should or shouldn't be working within or watch our kids were shorter than we have are so foreign one here thereby carry on our market there's laptop is only artworks and even if they're all showed off 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0041465-0042097 every minute to watch your kid you away a soccer game we are also last years socialite as rubbish 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0042097-0043255 so phone call sharjah part of the scheme oceanographers whether they be defeatist the question is no externally boys make huge areas of your kids' soccer game very different than what is 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0043255-0044538 joe everywhere we look but the big things in small things which are all things a little things wife is a matter of choice and the world we use a living look like this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0044742-0045623 that is to say to worsen choices but not everything was a matter of choice in the world we now live in what why kids and question is 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0045623-0046263 this is good news we're bench and the answer is yes 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0046554-0047602 we all know what's good about it jahangir to talk about what they're about all this choice has to affects today in effect on people 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0047602-0048920 what effect paradoxically senator dishes promises rather than a brush with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult issues at all 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0048920-0050062 how do you one very dramatic example of this study the wisdom of all investments to now voluntary retirement wins a colleague of mine got access to 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0050177-0051115 the best records from bangor these gigantic often probably have about a million employees of about two thousand for work wishes which is found is that 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051115-0051894 for every ten mutual funds you pour offered ray of participation went down two percent 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051894-0054066 your for fifty farms ten percent fewer employees participate if you all we offer five why because with fifty phones to choose from it so damn hard to decide which runs to choose that you just heard are often tomorrow and end tomorrow and end tomorrow and tomorrow went to war with of course to board a purpose 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0054066-0055420 understand that not only does this mean a keyboard happy dog food when they retire because i don't have enough money to wait it also means that maybe the decisions so hard that they have so significant matching money from in sport 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0055420-0056869 by not participating they're passing up as much as five thousand dollars in your premiums or would happily match their pocket huge joe kraus says is a consequence of having too many choices anything that makes the world look like this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0057498-0058253 you really what i get the decision right if it for all eternity right you know what a paper on which often driven the wrong shelters 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0058253-0059016 so what will affect the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a church 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0059016-0060008 we can go were satisfied with the result of the choice then we would be if we have fewer options situation and are several reasons for this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0060008-0061247 one of them is that would wander from sao addresses to choose from if you bought one it's not perfect and you know what salad dressing is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0061247-0062516 and what happens is this imagined alternative and issues your breath decision you make and his regret subtract from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you make even if it was a good position 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0062516-0063239 the more options there or the hoosiers churn rate anything at all was disappointed about the option that you chose 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0063239-0064442 second what economists call opportunity costs they go or maybe points warning of talking about how how much food over the way in which we find things that can so what we compare them to 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0064442-0065375 well what are lots of alternatives to consider is easy to one edge of the attractive features of alternative venue reject 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0065517-0066069 and that maybe you were satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen is an example 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066069-0066421 for those of you on your side pocket 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066421-0067741 but this one is supposed to be thinking irresistible on manhattan's very expensive roast a gorgeous beach beautiful they may have them all to themselves what could be better well they met this guy is thinking it's august 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0067741-0068445 everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is a way i can keep harping right in front of my do 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0068445-0069441 and he spends two weeks named by the idea that he's missing the opportunity day after day to have a great purpose 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0069441-0070466 opportunity cost subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose even when will we choose a church and more options there or to consider 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0070466-0071150 the more attractive features of these options for pointed to reflect the biases opportunity cause is another trap 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0071609-0072731 now now that this continental appointed next point about living in the moment as well and probably about giving slowly but once pointed makes us that whenever you're choosing one figure 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0072731-0073478 choosing not to do other things and those are the things they have what an attractive features is that they were doing was tracked work 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0073478-0074419 escalation of expectations this hit me when i went replace my genes i were jizo also time and there was a time when she's came in one flavor 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0074419-0075648 the new ball and an eighth <unk> wisecracking they're incredibly accountable if you will and one of the worst of an appetiser to fit feel ok so what replace my genes after years and years of words all ones anti-semite 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0075648-0077665 gowariker genes is the size of the shopkeeper said you want something easy thing roubaix fit your bonfires ypres why you would stonewashed arrest washed you won a distress call to copy white paper baba bollywood my jaw dropped after crisis what crimes they used to be your car 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078109-0078372 he had no idea what that was 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078372-0079678 so i said well we're trying not always thingies to mallorca misfortunes with the best thing genes i had ever had id better all his choice made it possible for me to do better 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0079678-0080552 but i felt watch wine or a whole book to try to squeeze to myself there isn't it 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0080992-0082076 the reason i felt worse is that we're not all of these options available my expectations about how good the pair change should be wind up 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0082076-0083475 i have very low which i had no particular expectations of the weekend one flavor we're making a hummer flavors they've on one attention of wonderful when i got was good but was imperfect and so i compare when i got to what i expected 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0083475-0084041 when i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected adding options to people's lives 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0084041-0085502 hit hoped would increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be aware that pointed produces one satisfaction with with results the weather conditions nobody in the world of marketing noses 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085502-0085781 but if they did 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085781-0086326 you would all know what this is about the truth is more like this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0086674-0087775 the reason that everything was better back with everything was worse is that when everything was worse it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were puzzles approx 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0087775-0088887 nowadays the world we live in we have what in the snow white citizens with perfection the expectation the best you can ever hope for is that as the position is huge but today 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0088887-0090231 you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations by expectations about the group the secret to happiness as we're talking for the secret of happiness is low expectations 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0091167-0092769 or sages obama memoir by dreadful moments that though i actually am married to a wife and then she's really quite wonderful i could have done better and so on but so does the dosage of betting falling 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0092769-0094116 one consequence of by the banking anchorages when there's only one kind of bike is that when you were dissatisfied new west widens as possible the answer is we are the world church possible webpage you do 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0094116-0095401 when there are hundreds of defense thousand genes available and you by one that is disappointing that u.s. why who's responsible is equally query that he asked the question is is you 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0095401-0096794 you could have done better with about one another different kinds of genes on display there's no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even over the voters also decisions for good they feel disappointed 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0096794-0099151 about them between themselves clinical depression has exploded in industry worldwide generation i believe a significant mattioli but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also show which side is that people have it's the races rather disappointing as educators us alive and then when it mattered sweeney's its greatest themselves they think they are at fault 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099151-0099870 and so the net result is that we do better temple in general objectively that we fuel worship 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099870-0100615 so what we are my view this is the official forum the one we all take to be true 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0100615-0101431 asphalt falls it is not true there's no question that some choices better venom 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0101431-0102631 but it doesn't fall from that the more choices better than some chose this a magical about tarawa it is utterly confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0102631-0103651 our welfare now as a policy metro almost on this policy matter the thing to think about is this what enables us all this choice 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0103651-0104500 in augusta societies is that your wackos there are lots of places in the world we've heard about several of them 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0104500-0105476 we're told their problem is not that they have too much choice their problems that they have to local services i'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0105483-0106567 adequate western societies what is so frustrating and infuriating is this the one that got yesterday about how these expensive and difficult ones fall 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0106690-0107078 infants to chelsea's both hope 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0107078-0108308 it's a waste of money what i'm telling you is that these expensive complicating choices is not simply that they don't hope that we'd hurt the actually make us worse 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0108308-0109445 off if some of what enables people in our societies to make all the choices we make we're shifted to societies in which people have too few options 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0109445-0110503 bollywood those cuba's weinstein proof but powers would be improved also is what economists call prego improving move income redistribution will make everyone 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0110503-0111279 they're off by just porky because of how all such a church points so to conclude
