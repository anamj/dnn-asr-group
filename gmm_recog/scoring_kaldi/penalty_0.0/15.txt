AlGore_2009-0001304-0002346 so these two slices that demonstrate that your entire step which for most of the last three billion years has been the size of the lower forty eight states has grown by forty percent 
AlGore_2009-0002346-0004004 but this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice the arctic ice cap is in a sense of the beating heart of the global climate system because that's where the democrats things about the next slide show you will be 
AlGore_2009-0004004-0005268 the rapid transport of what happened over the last twenty five years the prices more contract the s.e.c. inexpensive with or without a genuine somewhere in the contracts in summer 
AlGore_2009-0005268-0006029 and the so called to minimize five years or older this is almost one block the one out of the body here 
AlGore_2009-0006260-0006905 in twenty five years it's gone from those of us this is a problem because the warming 
AlGore_2009-0006905-0008633 he stopped the frozen ground around the arctic ocean where there's a massive amount of frozen carbon which one it was the turn of the decade by microbes compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere that amount of double if we cross this tipping point 
AlGore_2009-0008633-0009790 already socialism last that methane is actively but we know about the war effort in the water from the university of alaska without with another team to another shot late last month 
AlGore_2009-0011068-0011830 he said that the question is whether we will be one reason is the smallest of the city's subway one from the north 
AlGore_2009-0011830-0012659 this is an annual healthy rather than the volumes are much more for the very first thing you see here in south west 
AlGore_2009-0012659-0013511 every one of you will know how sea level rises on land based ice melting this is where everything is also increasing rapidly 
AlGore_2009-0013511-0014534 at the other end of the planet and already the largest mass of ice on the planet was mad scientists are already at our common is now an edited by his balance and west antarctica 
AlGore_2009-0014534-0015409 probably possible to see i was is tightly wrapped up in a small thing that's people that we see conceivable that is true 
AlGore_2009-0015409-0016856 in animal is the third largest mass of ice at the top you see you later with a few years ago glaciers we first of all people in the world after drinking water from the melting pot in the end is this glacier is a source of drinking water for the city 
AlGore_2009-0016856-0018678 the flows of increase but when they go away so that much of the drinking water in california there's the four percent decline in the sierra snowpack this is in the throes of wars and productions as you read more serious is trying to round the world has led to a dramatic increase in force 
AlGore_2009-0018678-0020516 and the disasters all around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary an unprecedented rate four times as many in the last three years as in the previous seventy five this is a completely unsustainable and if you look at it in the context of the street you can see 
AlGore_2009-0020516-0020955 what is it that way 
AlGore_2009-0020955-0021791 in the last five years without a seventy million tons of c o two every twenty four hours with a billion times every day to the oceans 
AlGore_2009-0021791-0022916 look carefully at the revenues from the survey from the americas extending westwood and on the other side of the indian subcontinent whether they were caught up with the bottom in the oceans 
AlGore_2009-0022916-0023668 the biggest single cause of global warming along with deforestation which is what percentage of the burning of fossil fuels all the product 
AlGore_2009-0023668-0025415 and call this the most serious problem the united states is one of the two largest emitters on the tarmac and a proposal has been to build a lot more complex but we're beginning to see a sea change are the ones that have been tested in the last two years with the green alternatives to perform 
AlGore_2009-0025415-0027030 however there is a political battle in our country and the coal industry and we all must respect for the billion dollars in the last hundred years promoting we call which is an oxymoron that image reminded me of something 
AlGore_2009-0027370-0028949 a white christmas in my home intimacy a billion gallons of course why it was that you probably saw on the news this all over the country to sag awards were screened in america this happened around christmas medical industry spent about christmas was of course 
AlGore_2009-0030430-0031168 the source of much of that no one was hurt in a modest amount of minor is the mathematical 
AlGore_2009-0031304-0031979 o'rourke nancy pelosi harry and i want to talk about 
AlGore_2009-0031979-0032607 so the alliance for climate protection has also took them and this is one of them or that one of them 
AlGore_2009-0032607-0033881 she we due to climate change is a very serious threat to world as much as we made our primary goal to spend a large sum of money online advertising efforts to promote and complicate the truth about goals 
AlGore_2009-0033881-0034242 but it is crucial to deal with it 
AlGore_2009-0034336-0034477 so stay tuned 
AlGore_2009-0034538-0035003 so don't worry about climate change and these animals 
AlGore_2009-0035176-0035680 we call it was interested in our political system 
AlGore_2009-0035977-0036537 this 
AlGore_2009-0036643-0037401 
AlGore_2009-0037401-0037909 i'm writing 
AlGore_2009-0037909-0038534 finally the cost of alternative matches with economic challenge of our national security challenge 
AlGore_2009-0038534-0039066 there is some trusts his insurer hiscox 
AlGore_2009-0039066-0039615 according to court records 
AlGore_2009-0039615-0040079 this whole 
AlGore_2009-0040079-0040921 it's not really interesting here is one in a hundred years 
AlGore_2009-0040921-0041490 leap forward in time of war 
AlGore_2009-0041490-0041607 this is the last one 
AlGore_2009-0042315-0043056 about three thousand five hundred thousand ways fundamental very few scheduling conflict 
AlGore_2009-0043195-0043622 he took over here with some of the new emerging markets 
AlGore_2009-0043770-0044092 the universe is very high paying jobs 
AlGore_2009-0044281-0044591 we know how to manage to get real 
AlGore_2009-0044591-0045669 there's an old african proverb that says if you would look what we call if you want to forgo together we need to go for what we 
AlGore_2009-0045669-0045797 thank you very much 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001224-0001955 talk about them so that in his book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things that you've already heard about china 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001955-0002689 but the conditions were sold in case you missed them will start with what i call the official 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0002689-0003874 if you don't want the official cause of all western industrial societies and efficient morons like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0003874-0004912 the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0004912-0006224 the new ball worthwhile essential to be human and because of people have freedom that each of us come back tomorrow to do the things that we maximize our welfare no one has to decide on their behalf 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0006224-0007545 the way to maximize freedom is to maximise towards the more choice people have more freedom they have more freedom they have them all over the world 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0007545-0008962 this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that would encourage anyone to question and it also deeply embedded in our lives 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0008962-0009855 give you some examples of what modern progress has been made possible for us this is my supermarket that such a big one 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0009855-0010532 or assailants were about seven percent or seventy five sowed the seeds of a supermarket if you don't count 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0010532-0011842 but in fact a virtual worlds and will call centers you combine to make a very large number of your own so this is the off chance that the other seventy five the store has to offer changes 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0011842-0012947 so this is what the shooter games like and then you go to the consumer electronics or to set up a stereo system speaker cd player tape player to rapid fire and in this world 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0012947-0013956 single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0013956-0015043 the french resistance and of course the drama from one story began to watch lists and other domains the world global communications 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0015043-0016393 there was a time when i was a boy when you can get any kind of water shortages was came from although you read it or forty gigabyte one consequence of that by the way is in the form of a broken ankle 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0016393-0017265 those days are not without having to call someone with a variety of forms especially the world cellphones use their cell phones in the future 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0017265-0017960 but there is a minority mp three player knows her children properly torch added 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0018189-0019251 if i suggest you haven't seen any your story that you can rest assured that one day she knew well what is that these people talking to their scores asking this question 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0019251-0020164 and you know the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to myself a little bit too much so 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0020164-0021506 in other aspects of life in a much more significant than out by things that saying that sort of choices for health care is no longer the case in the united states thank you 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0021506-0022404 but the doctrine of that tells you what do you say you go to the doctor and i can tell you a weekend away we can do the same as these benefits 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0022404-0023325 any risks because these benefits and risks when you were a kid and you say about what should i do in the boxes 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0023325-0024559 they have these benefits and risks and because these benefits and risks when you what do you say if you worry about what would you do in the process but about me 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0024559-0026795 and the result is we call a patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing when it really is is a shifting of government responsible for decision making and somebody you know something they were the doctor somebody who knows nothing of the culturally sick and those are the best they can be making decisions made by the patient now there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0026795-0028208 the people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense last weekend i know when the market was affected by then the answer is that dates back to support for the next morning and ask for politicians to be changed 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0028208-0029108 something as dramatic as our identity is now become a matter of choice now this slide 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0029108-0030333 is that you were convicted we get away with her identity we get one that we get reinvent ourselves as often as we like an amazing every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030333-0030923 you will be arm in arm with respect to marriage and family 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030923-0032176 there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone has to be the various initiatives and you start having physicians you turn up the only real choice was cool 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0032176-0033102 that way and that when you do that nowadays everything is very much a threat to teach wonderfully intelligence students 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0033102-0034166 and so i guess i'm twenty percent which would provide issue is that because there was worse to stop because there was a legend it's because they are preoccupied 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034166-0034940 asking themselves should i get married or not to get carried out within hours later she might have to search for for your first 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034940-0036185 all these are consuming passion and try to answer these questions whether or not it means that we all work i decided not to be driven by courses and indeed they should be shared with questions to answer 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036404-0036516 work 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036516-0037766 we are twice as far as we do now with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from a place on the planet except the remote control 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0038294-0039241 there is one quarter by the way the amount of time by labour you actually rather already have won five words but i knew that i will use it on 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0039241-0040156 so what this means is incredible freedom of choice reactors that work is that we have to make decisions again and again and again about whether 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0040156-0041465 we should or shouldn't be working with in which our kids were shorter than we ever so for a woman and a black bear market there's a laptop is only artworks and even if they all show off 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0041465-0042097 there are no matter what your kid you play soccer game we are also less your social life is rubbish 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0042097-0043255 so far cultures part of the scheme oceanographers what are the messages to the question is no it's certainly going to make a series of your kids are in very different than what is 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0043255-0044538 so where were you look on the basis of small things that are all things a little things like is a matter of choice and will use all of them look like this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0044742-0045623 that is to say they were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice in the world without leaving looks like this and the question is 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0045623-0046263 this is good news bad news and the answer is yes 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0046554-0047602 we all know what to do about it so i want to talk about what they're about all this choice as to the facts to begin with its own people 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0047602-0048920 what effect paradoxically is that produces promises rather than a brush with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult issues at all 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0048920-0050062 i'll give you one very dramatic example of this study that was an overall investment in our voluntary retirement was a colleague of mine got access to 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0050177-0051115 the best records from before this gigantic often probably about a million employees about two thousand of the world which is what she found is that 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051115-0051894 for every ten mutual funds that were offered with participation went down two percent 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051894-0054066 your for fifty pounds ten percent fewer employees participate if you will to fight why because with his response to choose from its own damn hard to decide which one to choose and you just awful tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course of our government 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0054066-0055420 i understand that not only does this mean that you've already got one their party doesn't have enough money to the way it also means that made the decision so hard that they have succeeded in getting away from the sport 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0055420-0056869 i'm not participating they're passionate as much as five thousand dollars a year for a week or what have we better product to process is a consequence of having too many choices and i think it makes the world look like this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0057498-0058253 you really want to get the decision right in detroit really right you know what they brought into force a broad shoulders 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0058253-0059016 so what was the sight of the fact is that even if we manage to overcome the process and make choices 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0059016-0060008 windows were satisfied with the results of the choice then we would be if we have fewer options situation there are several reasons for this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0060008-0061247 one of them is that we know what a difference that addresses issues from if you bought one is not perfect and it works out to see is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0061247-0062516 and what happens is this imagined alternative and ensure that the decision you make and his restaurant in the sense that you get better decision making it was a good position 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0062516-0063239 the more options are forty years or write anything at all was disappointed about architecture 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0063239-0064442 second what economists call opportunity cost the government and the quickest way of talking about how how much over the way in which we find things that is what we compare them to 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0064442-0065375 well what are lots of alternatives to consider is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternative venue reject 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0065517-0066069 and that maybe you were satisfied with the alternative that shows you some examples 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066069-0066421 for those of you on your side pocket 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066421-0067741 but it was supposed to be thinking irresistible on manhattan's very expensive real estate or just each beautiful they may have also themselves what could be better well there because i think it's august 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0067741-0068445 everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is the way i can keep working right in front of my goal 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0068445-0069441 and he spends two weeks made by the idea that is missing the opportunity day after day to have a great purpose 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0069441-0070466 opportunity cost of petrol dissatisfaction with a lot of what we choose even when we choose a church and more options there are considered 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0070466-0071150 the more attractive features of these options are going to be affected by a starter because his mother said 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0071609-0072731 now that it is hard to make the point that makes a point about living in the moment as well and probably about giving slowly but one point to make is that whenever you're choosing one opinion 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0072731-0073478 choosing not to do other things and those are the things we have lots of attractive features is that they were doing was trying to work 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0073478-0074419 escalation of expectations this to me when i went to replace my genes which is also time and there was a time when she said it was later 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0074419-0075648 the new ball or anything like that they're incredibly uncomfortable if you were one of the worst of the lot of different things you will pay someone to replace my days after years and years of words on one side by side 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0075648-0077665 the weather changes the size of the shopkeeper said you want something easy thing to realize that you will acquire shepherds why he was so widespread support you want to stress that the party would pay for a long time with my jaw dropped after a crisis what kind of thing you should be your car 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078109-0078372 he had no idea what that was 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078372-0079678 so i said well we're trying to always think she's a network of supporters with the best thing she's i have never had an idea that are all his choice made it possible for me to do better 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0079678-0080552 but i felt which wine or a whole book to try to squeeze to myself 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0080992-0082076 the reason i felt worse is that we have all these options available my expectations about how good a pair of changing the way up 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0082076-0083475 i had a very long way to go to the expectations of the weekend once we were working on a new flavors that a woman should understand why there was good but was a perfect and so i compare what i got all excited 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0083475-0084041 when i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected any options to people's lives 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0084041-0085502 it hopes to increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be the one that would reduce his life satisfaction with with results the weather conditions nobody in the world of marketing those things 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085502-0085781 but if they did 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085781-0086326 you will know what this is about the truth is more like this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0086674-0087775 the reason that everything was better than when everything was worse is that when everything was of course it was actually possible for people to have experiences that worked as a surprise 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0087775-0088887 nowadays the world we live in a way that would industrialize citizens with perfection expectation the best you can ever hope for is that was supposed to be just the ticket 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0088887-0090231 you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations were expectations about the group the secret to happiness as we're talking for the secret of happiness is low expectations 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0091167-0092769 i would say just one of them will fire at the moment that you know i actually am married to a wide and which is really quite wonderful i could have done better and so on but so is the most vexing problem 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0092769-0094116 one consequence of by attacking their genes when there's only one kind of like is that when you were dissatisfied and he was widely as possible the answer is we are the world is also what would you do 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0094116-0095401 when there are hundreds of diversity is available and you by one that is disappointing that u.s. wireless as possible is equally if we are to be asked the question is is you 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0095401-0096794 you could have done better with about one hundred different ideas on display there's no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even more voters also decisions for what they feel disappointed 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0096794-0099151 about out between themselves clinical depression has exploded in industry worldwide generation i believe is significant that the only been a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experience as disappointing as educators is alive and then what happens when the disgraced themselves they think they are at fault 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099151-0099870 and so the net result is that we do better at home in general objectively we feel worse 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099870-0100615 so let me remind you this is the official forum where we all pay to be true 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0100615-0101431 and it all falls is not true there's no question that some choices better than others 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0101431-0102631 but it doesn't format and more choices better than some chose this a medical marijuana is utterly confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0102631-0103651 i will fear now is a policy marathon is a policy that are the thing to think about this is what enables all this choice 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0103651-0104500 the biggest societies is that your wife knows there are lots of places in the world we've heard about several of them 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0104500-0105476 well the problem is not that they have too much choice their problems that they have to listen to this i'm talking about is the peculiar problem of water 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0105483-0106567 at ford western societies was so frustrated during this is the one that got yesterday about how this expensive and difficult ones so 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0106690-0107078 if the state agencies don't help 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0107078-0108308 it's a waste of money what i'm telling you is that these expensive complicated choices is not simply that they don't hope that we heard that we may get worse 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0108308-0109445 or if some of what makes people in our society to make all the choices we make we're shifted to societies in which people have too few options 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0109445-0110503 now one of those people i speak truth to power could be improved also is what economists call prego improving low income redistribution will make everyone 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0110503-0111279 there was not a sport because of the whole sections charge points so to conclude 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0111279-0112192 it's a story this cartoon and a sophisticated person say what is just to show you know that it is possible that this fall 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0112295-0113151 in part the imagination myopic view of the world and that's where the first of all i thought about it however the more i came to the view that is 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0113151-0114308 this notion that the truth of the matter is that if you share a fishbowl so that anything is possible you have freedom you have four hours 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0114308-0115008 if you share this is also that everything is possible you decrease satisfaction
