AlGore_2009-0002346-0004004 but this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice your that ice cap is in a sense of the beating heart of the global climate system because there's anywhere and contract since about the bedside i'd show you will be

AlGore_2009-0006260-0006905 in twenty five years it's gone from those of us this is a problem because the warming 
AlGore_2009-0006905-0008633 he stopped the frozen ground round your approaching four there's a massive amount of frozen carbon which one of force is turned into methane by microbes compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere that amount of double if we cross this tipping point 
AlGore_2009-0008633-0009790 already socialism last that methane is actively baldwin about the water that are to be water from the university of alaska without with another team to another shot late last month 
AlGore_2009-0011068-0011830 he's ok the question is whether we will be and one reason is this enormous he said the supreme one from the north 
AlGore_2009-0011830-0012659 this is an annual melting river but the volumes are much more for health care services that can use the rural south west 
AlGore_2009-0012659-0013511 every one of you would know how sea level rises on land based ice melting this is where it leads to see these costs are increasing rapidly 
AlGore_2009-0013511-0014534 at the other end of the planet antarctica towards massive ice on the planet was mad scientists are already at our common is now a negative icebound and west antarctica

AlGore_2009-0016856-0018678 the flows of increase but when they go away so that much of the drinking water in california there's the four percent decline in the sierra snowpack this is in the browser wars and productions as you read it or serious is trying to round the world has led to a dramatic increase in fires 
AlGore_2009-0018678-0020516 and the disasters all around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary an unprecedented rate four times as many in the last three years as in the previous seventy five this is a completely unsustainable and if you look at it in the context of the street you can see 
AlGore_2009-0020516-0020955 what this is doing 
AlGore_2009-0020955-0021791 in the last five years without a seventy million tons of c o two every twenty four hours with five million times every day to the oceans

AlGore_2009-0023668-0025415 and call is the most serious problem the united states is one of the two largest emitters on the tarmac and a proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants but we're beginning to see a sea change are the ones that have been tested in the last two years with a green alternatives to perform 
AlGore_2009-0025415-0027030 however there is a political battle in our country and coal industries and we all must respect for the billion more than the last hour your promoting we call which is an oxymoron that image reminded me of something

AlGore_2009-0045669-0045797 by government 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001224-0001955 talk about some stuff that in his book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things that you've already heard about china 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001955-0002689 but some connections myself in case you missed them will start with what i call the official ball 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0002689-0003874 if you don't have watched the official cause of all western industrial societies inefficient morons like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0003874-0004912 the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0004912-0006224 the new ball worthwhile essential to be human and because if people have freedom that each of us come back tomorrow to do the things that we maximize our welfare no one has to decide on our behalf 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0006224-0007545 the way to maximise freedom is to maximise towards the more choice people have the more freedom they have no more freedom they have the more will further 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0007545-0008962 this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that would occur to anyone crashed and it also deeply embedded in our lives 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0008962-0009855 give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us this is my supermarket but such a big one 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0009855-0010532 or assailants were about to addressing a hundred seventy five soccer season was supermarket if you don't count 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0010532-0011842 sitting next to virtual worlds and will call semiconductors you combine to make a very large number of your own so addresses the off chance that the other seventy five the store has to offer juju 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0011842-0012947 so this is what the shooter games like and then you go to the consumer electronics or the senate stereo system speaker cd player tape player to rapid fire and in this world 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0012947-0013956 single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0013956-0015043 the first resistance and components are on offer one story about an abattoir choice in other domains the world global communications 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0015043-0016393 there was a time when i was a boy when you can get any control for search you want the swiss came from although the wreckage are forbidden by one consequence of that by the way is that before never broke and rome 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0016393-0017265 those days are now we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially the world cellphones these are cellphones in the future 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0017265-0017960 my favorite is the morning mp three player knows her children properly torch added 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0018189-0019251 if i suggest you haven't seen many years forget you can rest assured that one day shoot you well what is the sinhalese people talking to their scores asking this question 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0019251-0020164 and you know the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to myself on that goes into too much so 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0020164-0021506 in other aspects of life in a much more significant than now buying things the same topics portion of choice is true in health care is more vacation united states thank you 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0021506-0022404 but the doctrine of that tells you what to do instead you go to the doctor to doctor tells you a weekend away all we can do the same as these benefits 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0022404-0023325 and he trusts the huskies benefits and risks we wanted to finish a box which i do in the boxes 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0023325-0024559 they have these benefits and risks and he has these benefits risks when you want to <unk> and you say if you worry about what would you do and that says but about me 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0024559-0026795 and the result is we call a patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing when really uses a shifting of government responsible for decision making from somebody you know something they were the doctor somebody who knows nothing of the culturally sick and the sun the best they can be making decisions made with a patient now there's enormous marketing of protection for us 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0026795-0028208 the people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense last weekend either one of them or because if we can't buy them the answer is that dates back to support doctors the next morning and ask for politicians to be changed 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0028208-0029108 something as dramatic as our identity is now become a matter of choice now this slide 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0029108-0030333 is that you were convicted we get you will inherit identity we get we said we get reinvent ourselves as often as we like an amazing every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030333-0030923 you will be arm in arm with respect to marriage and family 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030923-0032176 there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone has to be the various initiatives and you start having physicians you turn up the only real choice was cool 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0032176-0033102 darwin and that when you do that nowadays everything is very much up for grabs i teach wonderfully intelligence tunes 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0033102-0034166 and so i assign twenty percent which would buy new shoes it's not because there was worse to stop because there was a legend it's because they are preoccupied 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034166-0034940 asking themselves should i get married or not to get carried out by ten hours later she might have to search for for your first 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034940-0036185 all these four consuming fresh and ready to these questions whether or not it means that we all work i decided not to be driven by courses and indeed they should be served four questions to answer 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036404-0036516 work 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036516-0037766 we are blessed squirrels pointed out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the remote control 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0038294-0039241 there is one quarter by the way the amount of time by labour you actually rather already high quantify works but i knew that i will use it on 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0039241-0040156 so what this means is incredible freedom of choice reactors that work is that we have to make decisions again and again and again about whether 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0040156-0041465 we should or shouldn't be working within which our kids were shorter than we ever so for a woman and a black berry on our market there's a laptop is only artworks and even if they all show off 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0041465-0042097 every no matter what your kid you play soccer game we are also less your social life is rubbish 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0042097-0043255 so for cultures part of the scheme oceanographers what are the messages to the question is no it's certainly going to make the series of your kids' soccer game very different than what is 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0043255-0044538 so everywhere we look but the big things in small things which are all things a little things like is a matter of choice and the world we use a living look like this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0044742-0045623 that is to say they were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice in the world without leaving looks like this and the question is 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0045623-0046263 this is good news or bad news and the answer is yes 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0046554-0047602 we all know what's good about it so i want to talk about what they're about all this choice has two facts to begin with its own people 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0047602-0048920 what effect paradoxically senator dishes promises rather than a brush with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult issues at all 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0048920-0050062 i'll give you one very dramatic example of this study the wisdom of all investments to now voluntary retirement plans a colleague of mine got access to 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0050177-0051115 the best records from bangor these gigantic often probably about a million employees of about two thousand for work which is what she found is that 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051115-0051894 for every ten mutual funds that were offered remote participation went down two percent 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051894-0054066 your for fifty pounds ten percent fewer employees participate if you'll often find why because with his response to choose from its own damn hard to decide which runs to choose and you just awful tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course the border purpose 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0054066-0055420 understand that not only does this mean that people were happy dog food when they retire because i don't have enough money to work it also means that made the decision so hard that they have so significant matching away from the sport 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0055420-0056869 by not participating they're passionate as much as five thousand dollars in your premiums or would happily metropolitan huge joe kraus says is a consequence of having too many choices anything that makes the world look like this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0057498-0058253 you really what i get the decision right in detroit really right you know what they brought into force in the wrong shelters 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0058253-0059016 so what will affect the sight of the fact is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make choices 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0059016-0060008 windows were satisfied with the result of the choice then we would be if we have fewer options situation there are several reasons for this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0060008-0061247 one of them is that we know what a difference that addresses issues from if you bought one is not perfect and it works out to see is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0061247-0062516 and what happens is this imagined alternative and issues you're right decision you make and his right hip fracture dissatisfaction you get better decision you make even if it was a good position 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0062516-0063239 the more options there are forty years or write anything at all was disappointed about the option to choose 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0063239-0064442 second what economists call opportunity costs the government and the quickest way of talking about how how much over the way in which we find things that can so what we compare them to 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0064442-0065375 well what are lots of alternatives to consider is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternative venue reject 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0065517-0066069 and that maybe you were satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen is an example 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066069-0066421 for those of you on your side pocket 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066421-0067741 but this one is supposed to be thinking irresistible on manhattan's very expensive roast a gorgeous beach beautiful they may have also themselves what could be better well they make these guys thinking as of august 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0067741-0068445 everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is the way i can keep harping right in front of my boots 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0068445-0069441 and he spends two weeks made by the idea that he is missing the opportunity day after day to have a great purpose 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0069441-0070466 opportunity cost subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose even when will we choose a church and more options there or to consider 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0070466-0071150 the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected biases opportunity cost is another trap 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0071609-0072731 now how did this continental appointed exploitable living in the moment as well and probably about giving slowly but once pointed makes us that whenever you're choosing one opinion 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0072731-0073478 choosing not to do other things and those are the things we have lots of attractive features is that they were doing was trying to work 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0073478-0074419 escalation of expectations this hit me when i went to replace my genes which is also time and there was a time when she said one flavor 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0074419-0075648 the new ball or anything like that they're incredibly uncomfortable with you one on one of the worst one of five different things you will pay someone to replace my genes after years and years of words all ones anti-semite 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0075648-0077665 gowariker changes the size of the shopkeeper said you want something easy thing we like to go to acquire shepherds why he was so widespread support you want to stress gone to copy white paper will live with my jaw dropped after crisis what crimes they used to be your car 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078109-0078372 he had no idea what that was 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078372-0079678 so i said well we're trying not always think he's a man on the bus or train with the best thing she's i had ever had id they're all his choice made it possible for me to do better 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0079678-0080552 but i felt which wine or a whole book to try to squeeze to myself 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0080992-0082076 the reason i felt worse is that we have all these options available my expectations about how good the pair change should be wind up 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0082076-0083475 i have very low which i had no particular expectations of the weekend once we were working together flavors they've on one attention of a person without was good but was a perfect and so i compare what i got all excited 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0083475-0084041 when i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected any options to people's lives 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0084041-0085502 it hopes to increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be the one that would reduce his life satisfaction with with results the weather conditions nobody in the world of marketing noses 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085502-0085781 but if they did 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085781-0086326 you will know what this is about the truth is more like this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0086674-0087775 the reason that everything was better than when everything was worse is that when everything was worse it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were present products 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0087775-0088887 nowadays the world we live in a way that would industrialize citizens with perfection expectation the best you can ever hope for is that says that as soon as you expect to be 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0088887-0090231 you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations by expectations about the group the secret to happiness as we're talking for the secret of happiness is low expectations 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0091167-0092769 on stage as obama memoir by dreadful moments that you know i actually am married to a wide and then she's really quite wonderful i could have done better and so on but so is the most vexing falling 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0092769-0094116 one consequence of beiderbecke anchorages when there's only one kind of like is that when you were dissatisfied and he was quite as is possible the answer is we are the world church possible what would you do 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0094116-0095401 when there are hundreds of the five thousand genes available and you by one that is disappointing that u.s. wireless as possible is equally if we are to be asked the question is is you 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0095401-0096794 you could have done better with about one hundred different kinds of genes on display there's no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even more voters also decisions for what they feel disappointed 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0096794-0099151 about out between themselves clinical depression has exploded in industry worldwide generation i believe is significant that the only been a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experiences rather disappointing as educators is alive and then when they get what we need is greatest themselves they think they are at fault 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099151-0099870 and so the net result is that we do better temple in general objectively every few words 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099870-0100615 so let me remind you this is the official forum where we all take to be true 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0100615-0101431 asphalt falls is not true there's no question that some choices better venom 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0101431-0102631 but it doesn't follow from that the more choices better than some chose this a medical marijuana is utterly confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0102631-0103651 our welfare now has a policy marathon is a policy that are the thing to think about this is what enables all this choice 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0103651-0104500 in augusta societies is that your wackos there are lots of places in the world we've heard about several of them 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0104500-0105476 we're told the problem is not that they have too much choice their problems that they have to local services i'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0105483-0106567 at ford western societies what is so frustrating and if you're in this is the one that got yesterday about how this expensive and difficult ones so 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0106690-0107078 infants to charities both hope 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0107078-0108308 it's a waste of money what i'm telling you is that these expensive complicated choices is not simply that they don't hope that we heard that we make much worse 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0108308-0109445 off if some of what enables people in our societies to make all the choices we make we're shifted to societies in which people have too few options 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0109445-0110503 now one of those people i speak truth to power should be improved also is what economists call prego improving new income redistribution will make everyone 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0110503-0111279 they're off by just forty because of the whole sections charge points so to conclude 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0111279-0112192 it's a story this cartoon and a sophisticated person say what is this fish no you know that it is possible that this fall 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0112295-0113151 in part the imagination myopic view the world and that's where the buffers the more i thought about it however the more i came to the view that is 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0113151-0114308 this notion that the truth of the matter is that if you share a fishbowl so that everything is possible your have freedom you have four hours
