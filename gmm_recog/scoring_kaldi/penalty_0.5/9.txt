AlGore_2009-0018678-0020516 and the disasters all around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary an unprecedented rate four times as many in the last three years as in the previous seventy five this is a completely unsustainable and if you look at in the context of the street you can see 
AlGore_2009-0020516-0020955 what this is doing 
AlGore_2009-0020955-0021791 in the last five years we batted seventy million tons of c o two every twenty four hours with five billion tons every day to the oceans 
AlGore_2009-0021791-0022916 look carefully at fury of abuse from the survey from the americas extending westwood and on either side of the indians upon up we're there's a radical that we have a bottoming in the oceans 
AlGore_2009-0022916-0023668 the biggest single cause of global warming along with deforestation were just one person because the burning of fossil fuels was a product 
AlGore_2009-0023668-0025415 and call is the most serious prompt the united states is one of the two largest emitters along which on top and a proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants but we're beginning to see a sea change are the ones that have been tested in the last two years with a green alternatives to perform 
AlGore_2009-0025415-0027030 however there is a political battle in our country in the coal industries and we all must respect for the billion more some less counter your promoting we call which is an oxymoron that image reminded me of something

AlGore_2009-0044591-0045669 there's an old african proverb that says if you would look what we call if you would all four go together we need to go for what we 
AlGore_2009-0045669-0045797 i cover my 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001224-0001955 talk about some stuff that in his book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things that you've already heard about china 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001955-0002689 make some connections myself in case you missed them will start with what i call the official ball 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0002689-0003874 if you bought ofwat efficient all all for western industrial societies and efficient lawrence like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0003874-0004912 the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself goods 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0004912-0006224 the new ball worthwhile essential to be human and because if people have freedom that each of us come back tomorrow to do the things that we maximize our welfare no one has to decide on our behalf 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0006224-0007545 the way to maximise freedom is to maximise towards the more choice people have the more freedom they have and more freedom they have the more will further back 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0007545-0008962 this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that wouldn't occur to anyone crashed and it also deeply embedded in our lives 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0008962-0009855 give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us this is my supermarket but such a big one 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0009855-0010532 or assailants were about sow addressing a hundred seventy five soccer season was supermarket if you don't count 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0010532-0011842 that had better virtual worlds and will call seven hundred years you combine to make a very large number of your own so addresses the off chance that the other seventy five the store has to offer jooce 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0011842-0012947 so this is what the shooter games like and then you go to the consumer electronics or the senate stereo system speaker cd player tape player to rapid fire and in his will 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0012947-0013956 single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0013956-0015043 the first resistance and components are on offer one store you gotta make that a wider choice in other domains the world global communications 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0015043-0016393 there was a time when i was a boy when you can get any control for search you want the swiss came from although you wreckage are forbidden by one consequence of that by the way is that before never broke and rome 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0016393-0017265 those days are now we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially the world cellphones these are cellphones in the future 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0017265-0017960 my favorite is the morning mp three player knows her children properly torch added 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0018189-0019251 if by some chance you haven't seen added years forget you can rest assured that one day shoot you woke with his thousands of these people talking to their scores asking this question 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0019251-0020164 and you know the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to my cell phone that goes into too much so 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0020164-0021506 in other aspects of life in a much more significant than now buying things the same topics portion of choice is true in health care is more vacation united states thank you 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0021506-0022404 or the doctrine of that tells you what to do instead you go to the doctor in the market shows you a weekend away all we can do the same as these benefits 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0022404-0023325 and he trusts the huskies benefits and each risks when you were a kid and you say box which i do in the boxes 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0023325-0024559 they have these benefits and risks and he has these benefits risks when you want to <unk> and you say if you were read out what would you do the boxers but about me 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0024559-0026795 and the result is we call a patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing when really uses a shifting of government responsible for decision making from somebody you know something they were the doctor somebody who knows nothing of the culturally sick and was not in the best shape to be making decisions made with a patient now there's enormous more coming of protection drugs 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0026795-0028208 the people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense last weekend either one of them or to tell us if we can't buy them the answer is that dates back to support doctors the next morning and ask for politicians to be changed 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0028208-0029108 something as dramatic as our identity is now become a matter of choice now this slide 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0029108-0030333 is that you were convicted we get you will inherit identity we get we've ended we get reinvent ourselves as often as we like an amazing every day when you wake up in the morning you get to the sidewalk per person 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030333-0030923 you will be arm in arm with respect to marriage and family 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030923-0032176 there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone has is that you get married she knew she could and you start having physicians you turn up the only real choice was cool 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0032176-0033102 but when <unk> and that when you do that nowadays everything is very much up for grabs i teach wonderfully intelligence tunes 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0033102-0034166 and though i assign twenty percent which would buy new shoes it's not because there was worse to stop because there was a legend it's because they are preoccupied 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034166-0034940 asking themselves should i get married or not she may get married now shy to marry later she might have kids for cirque or your first 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034940-0036185 all these four consuming fresh and ready to these questions whether or not it means that we all work i decided not to be driven by courses and indeed they should be served four questions to answer 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036404-0036516 work 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036516-0037766 we are blessed us girls pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the remote control 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0038294-0039241 there is one quarter by the way the moment in time by labour you actually brother were behind why fireworks but i knew that i will use it on 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0039241-0040156 so what this means is incredible freedom of choice we have offers that work is that we have to make decisions again and again and again about whether 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0040156-0041465 we should or shouldn't be working within which our kids were shorter than we have are so for a woman and a black berry on our market there's a laptop is only artworks and even if they're all showed off 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0041465-0042097 every no matter what your kid you away a soccer game we are also less your social life is rubbish 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0042097-0043255 so for cultures part of the scheme oceanographers whether they be defeatist the question is no it's certainly going to make the series of your kids' soccer game very different than what is 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0043255-0044538 so everywhere we look but the big things in small things which are all things a little things wife is a matter of choice and the world we use a living look like this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0044742-0045623 that is to say they were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice in the world without leaving looks like this and question is 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0045623-0046263 this is good news or bad news and the answer is yes 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0046554-0047602 we all know what's good about it so i want to talk about what they're about all this choice has two facts to begin with its own people 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0047602-0048920 what effect paradoxically senator dishes promises rather than a brush with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult issues at all 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0048920-0050062 i'll give you one very dramatic example of this study the wisdom of all investments to now voluntary retirement wins a colleague of mine got access to 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0050177-0051115 the best records from bangor these gigantic often probably have about a million employees of about two thousand for work which is what she found is that 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051115-0051894 for every ten mutual funds that were offered rate of participation went down two percent 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051894-0054066 your for fifty pounds ten percent fewer employees participate if you'll often find why because with his response to choose from its own damn hard to decide which runs to choose that you just awful tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow when that person or their purpose 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0054066-0055420 understand that not only does this mean a keyboard happy dog food when they retire because i don't have enough money to weigh it also means that made the decision so hard that they have so significant matching away from the sport 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0055420-0056869 by not participating they're passionate as much as five thousand dollars in your premiums or would happily metropolitan huge joe kraus says is a consequence of having too many choices anything that makes the world look like this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0057498-0058253 you really what i get the decision right if it for all eternity right you know what they brought into force in the wrong shelters 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0058253-0059016 so what will affect the sight of the fact is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make good choices 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0059016-0060008 we can go were satisfied with the result of the choice then we would be if we have fewer options to change and are several reasons for this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0060008-0061247 one of them is that we know what a difference that addresses issues from if you bought one is not perfect and it works out to see is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0061247-0062516 and what happens is this imagined alternative and issues your breath decision you make and his right hip fracture dissatisfaction you get out of the decision you make even if it was a good position 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0062516-0063239 the more options there or the hoosiers churn rate anything at all was disappointed about the option to choose 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0063239-0064442 second what economists call opportunity costs in your baby point scoring of talking about how how much over the way in which we find things that can so what we compare them to 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0064442-0065375 well what are lots of alternatives to consider is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternative venue reject 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0065517-0066069 and that maybe you were satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen is an example 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066069-0066421 for those of you on your side pocket 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066421-0067741 but this one is supposed to be thinking irresistible on manhattan's very expensive roast a gorgeous beach beautiful they may have them all to themselves what could be better well they met this guy is thinking as of august 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0067741-0068445 everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is a way i can keep harping right in front of my do 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0068445-0069441 and he spends two weeks named by the idea that he is missing the opportunity day after day to have a great purpose 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0069441-0070466 opportunity cost subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose even when will we choose a church and more options there or to consider 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0070466-0071150 the more attractive features of these options for pointed to reflect the biases opportunity cause is another trap 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0071609-0072731 now how did this continental appointed exploitable living in the moment as well and probably about giving slowly but once pointed makes us that whenever you're choosing one figure 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0072731-0073478 choosing not to do other things and those are the things we have lots of attractive features is that they were doing was tracked work 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0073478-0074419 escalation of expectations this hit me when i went replace my genes i wear jeans also time and there was a time when she said one flavor 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0074419-0075648 the new ball or anything like that they're incredibly accountable if you were the one of the worst of the scottish certificate feel ok so what replace my genes after years and years of words all ones anti-semite 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0075648-0077665 gowariker genes is the size of the shopkeeper said you want something easy thing to relax thing you would acquire shepherds why he was so widespread support you won a distress call to copy what vapor bubble bollywood my jaw dropped after crisis what crimes they used to be your car 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078109-0078372 he had no idea what that was 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078372-0079678 so i said well we're trying not always think she's a man on the bus or train with the best thing genes i had ever had id better all his choice made it possible for me to do better 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0079678-0080552 but i felt which wine or a whole book to try to squeeze to myself there isn't it 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0080992-0082076 the reason i felt worse is that we're not all of these options available my expectations about how good the pair change should be wind up 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0082076-0083475 i have very low which i had no particular expectations of the weekend one flavor waking up under flavors they've on one attention of a person without was good but was a perfect and so i compare what i got all excited 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0083475-0084041 when i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected any options to people's lives 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0084041-0085502 it hopes to increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be the one that would have reduced his life satisfaction with with results the weather conditions nobody in the world of marketing noses 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085502-0085781 but if they did 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085781-0086326 you would all know what this is about the truth is more like this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0086674-0087775 the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were present products 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0087775-0088887 nowadays the world we live in we have witnessed why citizens with perfection expectation the best you can ever hope for is that says that as soon as you expect to be 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0088887-0090231 you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations by expectations about the group the secret to happiness as we're talking for the secret of happiness is low expectations 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0091167-0092769 on stage as obama memoir by dreadful moments that you know i actually am married to a wide and then she's really quite wonderful i could have done better and so on but so does the dosage of getting far away 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0092769-0094116 one consequence of by the banking anchorages when there's only one kind of bike is that when you were dissatisfied new was quite as is possible the answer is we are the world church possible what would you do 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0094116-0095401 when there are hundreds of the five thousand genes available and you by one that is disappointing that u.s. wireless as possible is equally if we are to be asked the question is is you 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0095401-0096794 you could have done better with about one out of a different kind of genes on display there's no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even more voters also decisions for good they feel disappointed 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0096794-0099151 about them between themselves clinical depression has exploded in industry worldwide generation i believe is significant that the only been a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experiences rather disappointing as educators us alive and then when it mattered sweeney's its greatest themselves they think they are at fault 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099151-0099870 and so the net result is that we do better temple in general objectively every few words 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099870-0100615 so what your mind you this is the official form the one we all take to be true 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0100615-0101431 asphalt falls it is not true there's no question that some choices better venom 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0101431-0102631 but it doesn't follow from that the more choices better than some chose this a medical marijuana is utterly confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0102631-0103651 our welfare now has a policy marijuana austin is a policy that are the thing to think about is this what enables us all this choice 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0103651-0104500 in augusta societies is that your wackos there are lots of places in the world we've heard about several of them 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0104500-0105476 we're told the problem is not that they have too much choice their problems that they have to local services i'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0105483-0106567 at ford western societies what is so frustrating and if you're in this is the one that got yesterday about how this expensive and difficult ones so 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0106690-0107078 infants to charities both hope 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0107078-0108308 it's a waste of money what i'm telling you is that these expensive complicating choices is not simply that they don't hope that we'd hurt the actually make us worse 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0108308-0109445 off if some of what enables people in our societies to make all the choices we make we're shifted to societies in which people have too few options 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0109445-0110503 now one of those people twice the truth but powers would be improved also is what economists call prego improving move income redistribution will make everyone 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0110503-0111279 they're off by just forty because of the whole sections church points so to conclude 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0111279-0112192 this whole story this cartoon and a sophisticated person say what is this fish no you know nothing is possible when this fish paul 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0112295-0113151 in part the imagination myopic view the world and that's where the buffers the more i thought about it however the more i came to the view that is
