AlGore_2009-0001304-0002346 this is like saying that demonstrate that your entire step which for most of the last three billion years has been the size of the lower forty eight states has grown by forty percent 
AlGore_2009-0002346-0004004 but this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice the arctic ice cap is in a sense of the beating heart of the global climate system because that's where the democrats things about the next slide show you will be

AlGore_2009-0005268-0006029 and the so called to minimize five years or older the system as we blocked the layout of the body here 
AlGore_2009-0006260-0006905 in twenty five years it's all numbers suggest this is a problem because the warming 
AlGore_2009-0006905-0008633 he stopped the frozen ground around the arctic ocean where there's a massive amount of frozen carbon which one it was the turn of the decade by microbes compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere that amount of double if we cross this tipping point 
AlGore_2009-0008633-0009790 already socialism lasted methane is actively between about one percent to the water from the university of alaska without would not need another colleague last month 
AlGore_2009-0011068-0011830 he said that the question is whether we will be one reason is the smallest of the city's subway one from the north 
AlGore_2009-0011830-0012659 this is an annual healthy rather than the volumes are much more for the very first thing you see here in south west 
AlGore_2009-0012659-0013511 we wanted to know how sea level rises on land based ice melting this is where everything is also increasing rapidly 
AlGore_2009-0013511-0014534 at the other end of the planet and already the largest mass of ice on the planet was mad scientist already part time and is now a negative icebound and west antarctica 
AlGore_2009-0014534-0015409 probably possibility i was is tightly wrapped up in this building as people that we see conceivable that is true 
AlGore_2009-0015409-0016856 the minimalist rewards maximize at the top you see you later with a few years ago glaciers we first of all people in the world after drinking water from the melting pot in the end is this glacier is a source of drinking water for the city 
AlGore_2009-0016856-0018678 that was an increase but when they go away so that much of the drinking water in california there's the four percent decline in the sierra snowpack assisting reservoirs and production system rather more serious is trying to round the world has led to a dramatic increase in force 
AlGore_2009-0018678-0020516 and the disastrous around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary an unprecedented rate or congressmen in the last three years as in the previous seventy five this is a completely unsustainable and if you look at it in the context of history you can see 
AlGore_2009-0020516-0020955 what is the story 
AlGore_2009-0020955-0021791 in the last five years without a seventy million tons of c o two every twenty four hours with a billion times every day to the oceans 
AlGore_2009-0021791-0022916 look carefully at the revenues from the survey from the americas extending westwood and on the other side of the indian subcontinent brothers they went to the police department in the oceans 
AlGore_2009-0022916-0023668 the biggest single cause of global warming along with deforestation which is what percentage of the burning of fossil fuels all the product 
AlGore_2009-0023668-0025415 and called it the most serious problem the united states is one of the two largest emitters on top and a proposal has been to build a lot more complex but we're beginning to see a sea change are the ones that have been tested in the last two years with the green alternatives to perform 
AlGore_2009-0025415-0027030 however there is a political battle in our country and the coal industry and enormous respect for the building for the last hundred years maybe we call which is an oxymoron that image reminded me of something 
AlGore_2009-0027370-0028949 a white christmas in my home intimacy a billion gallons of course why it was that you probably saw on the news this all over the country to sag awards were screened in america this happened around christmas medical industry spent about christmas with us

AlGore_2009-0031979-0032607 so the alliance for climate protection has also put them and this is one of them or that one of them 
AlGore_2009-0032607-0033881 she worried you climate change is a very serious threat to our position as a reminder that are going to spend a large sum of money online advertising efforts to promote and complicated the bottle 
AlGore_2009-0033881-0034242 but it is crucial to deal with it 
AlGore_2009-0034336-0034477 so stay tuned 
AlGore_2009-0034538-0035003 so don't worry about climate change and these animals 
AlGore_2009-0035176-0035680 we call it was interested in our political system

AlGore_2009-0037401-0037909 writing 
AlGore_2009-0037909-0038534 finally the cost of alternative matches with economic challenge of our national security 
AlGore_2009-0038534-0039066 his interests he said your house 
AlGore_2009-0039066-0039615 according to court records

AlGore_2009-0040079-0040921 the percentage of electricity one in a hundred years 
AlGore_2009-0040921-0041490 people were killed in the war 
AlGore_2009-0041490-0041607 this is a worthwhile 
AlGore_2009-0042315-0043056 about three thousand five hundred thousand ways fundamental very few scheduling conflict 
AlGore_2009-0043195-0043622 over here with some of the new emerging markets 
AlGore_2009-0043770-0044092 users industrialized nations 
AlGore_2009-0044281-0044591 we found an integral 
AlGore_2009-0044591-0045669 there's an old african proverb that says if you would know what we call it would afford altogether we need to go for quickly 
AlGore_2009-0045669-0045797 the government 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001224-0001955 talk about them so that in his book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things that you've already heard about china 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001955-0002689 but the conditions were sold in case you missed it will start with what i call the official 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0002689-0003874 if you don't want efficient all western industrial societies inefficient morons like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0003874-0004912 the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0004912-0006224 the new ball worthwhile essential to be human and because of people have freedom that each of us come back tomorrow to do things to maximize welfare will have to decide on their behalf 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0006224-0007545 the way to maximize freedom is to maximize towards the more choice people have more freedom they have more freedom to have them all over the world 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0007545-0008962 this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that would encourage anyone to question and it also deeply embedded in our lives 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0008962-0009855 give you some examples of what modern progress has been made possible for us this is my supermarket that such a big one 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0009855-0010532 or assailants were about seven percent or seventy five celebrations in a supermarket you don't count 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0010532-0011842 but in fact a virtual worlds and we'll call centers you combine to make a very large numbers are also addresses the off chance that the other seventy five the store has to offer change 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0011842-0012947 so this is what the shooter games like many other consumer electronics or senator stereo system speaker cd player tape player rapid fire in this world 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0012947-0013956 single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0013956-0015043 the french resistance and of course the drama from one story began to watch lists and other domains the world global communications 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0015043-0016393 there was a time when i was a boy when you can get any kind of water shortages which came from about your at age forty gigabyte or consequences that by the way is in the form of a broken ankle 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0016393-0017265 but this time without having to call someone with a variety of roles especially the world cellphones use their cell phones in the future 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0017265-0017960 but there is a minority mp three player knows her children properly torch added 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0018189-0019251 if i suggest you haven't seen any your story that you can rest assured that one day she knew well what is that these people talking to their scores asking this question 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0019251-0020164 and you know the answer to this question now is the answer is no it's not possible to myself a little bit too much so 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0020164-0021506 in other aspects of life in a much more significant than buying things the same sort of choices for healthcare is often the case in the united states thank you 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0021506-0022404 but the doctrine of that tells you what do you say you go to the doctor and i can tell you a weekend away we can do the same as these benefits 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0022404-0023325 any risks because these benefits and risks we wanted to michigan which i do in the boxes 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0023325-0024559 they have these benefits and risks and because these benefits risks when you what do you say if you worry about what would you do the boxes barack obama 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0024559-0026795 and the result is weak location the economy which makes it sound like a good thing when religious shifting of government responsible for decision making and somebody you know something they wurzelbacher somebody who knows nothing of the culturally sick and often the best they can be making decisions made by the patient now there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0026795-0028208 people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense last weekend i know when the market was affected by then the answer is that it's better support for the next morning and ask for politicians to be changed 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0028208-0029108 something as dramatic as our identity is now become a matter of choice now this slide 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0029108-0030333 but who were convicted we get away with her identity we get one that we don't reinvent ourselves as often as we like an amazing every day we wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030333-0030923 you will be an encounter with respect to marriage and family 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030923-0032176 there was a time when the false assumption that almost everyone has to be the various initiatives and you start having physicians you turn up the only real choice was cool 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0032176-0033102 darwin and that when you do that nowadays everything is very much a threat to teach wonderfully intelligence students 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0033102-0034166 and so i decided to twenty percent was what i used to describe a poster what's worse is that because there was a legend it's because they are preoccupied 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034166-0034940 as individuals should i get married or not to get carried out within hours later she might have to search for truth hurts 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034940-0036185 all these are consuming passion and dedication these questions whether or not it means that we all work by simon boccanegra workforce and indeed they should be shared with questions to answer 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036404-0036516 work 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036516-0037766 we are blessed squirrels pointed out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from a place on the planet except the remote control 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0038294-0039241 there is one quarter by the way the amount of time by labour you actually rather grandly i quantify works but i knew that we're using them 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0039241-0040156 so what this means is incredible freedom of choice reactors that work is that we have to make decisions again and again and again about women 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0040156-0041465 we should or shouldn't be working within which are simply shorter than we ever so for a woman and a black bear market there's a laptop is only artworks even if they all show off 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0041465-0042097 every network articulate soccer game we are also ask your social activists 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0042097-0043255 so far cautious optimism oceanographers whether anybody asked the question is no it's certainly going to make a series of your kids are in very different languages 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0043255-0044538 so everywhere we look on the basis of small things that are all things a little things like is a matter of choice and will use all of them look like this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0044742-0045623 that is to say the word socialism and everything was a matter of choice in the world without leaving looks like this and the question is 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0045623-0046263 this is good news bad news and the answer is yes 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0046554-0047602 we all know what's good about trying to talk about what they're about all this choice as to the facts to begin with its own people 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0047602-0048920 what effect paradoxically centrifuges promises rather than a brush with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult issues at all 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0048920-0050062 i'll give you one very dramatic example of this study that was an overall investment in our voluntary retirement was a colleague of mine got access to 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0050177-0051115 the best records from before this gigantic often probably about a million employees about two thousand of the world which is what you find is that 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051115-0051894 for creating mutual funds that were offered with participation went down two percent 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051894-0054066 your for fifty pounds ten percent fewer employees participate if you will to fight why because of his response to choose from so damn hard to decide which one to choose and you just awful tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course the participants 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0054066-0055420 i understand that not only does this mean that you've already got one their party doesn't have enough money to work it also means that made the decision so hard that they have succeeded in getting away from the sport 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0055420-0056869 i'm not participating they're passionate as much as five thousand dollars in your family or what have we better product to process is a consequence of having too many choices anything that makes the world look like this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0057498-0058253 you really want to get the decision right in detroit really right you know what the provision for the broad shoulders 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0058253-0059016 so that within sight of the fact is that even if we manage to overcome the process and make choices 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0059016-0060008 windows were satisfied with the results of the choice we would be if we have fewer options situation for several reasons 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0060008-0061247 one of them is that a lot of the celebrations to choose from if you bought one is the perfect antidote to address it is easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice would be better 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0061247-0062516 and what happens is this imagine alternative and insecurity decision you make and his restaurant in the sense that you get better decision making it was a decision 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0062516-0063239 the more options are forty years or write anything at all was disappointed about architecture 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0063239-0064442 second what economists call opportunity cost the government and the quickest way of talking about how how much over the way in which we find things that is what we compare them to 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0064442-0065375 well what are lots of alternatives to consider is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternative venue reject 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0065517-0066069 and that maybe you were satisfied with the alternative that shows you some examples 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066069-0066421 for those of you on your side pocket 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066421-0067741 but it was supposed to be thinking irresistible on manhattan's very expensive real estate or just these beautiful they may have lost themselves what could be better well there because i think it's august 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0067741-0068445 everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is the way i can keep working right in front of my goal 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0068445-0069441 he spent two weeks made by the idea that is missing the opportunity today after they'd have a great purpose 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0069441-0070466 opportunity cost structure dissatisfaction with a lot of what we choose even when we choose a church and more options are worth considering 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0070466-0071150 the more attractive features of these options are going to be affected by a starter because his mother said 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0071609-0072731 however despite initial appointed exploitable living in the moment as well and probably about it this way but when we make sure that whatever you're choosing one opinion 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0072731-0073478 choosing not to do other things and those are the things that are quite attractive features they were doing was trying to work 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0073478-0074419 escalation of expectations basically when i went to replace my cheese sandwich is also time and there was a time when she said it was later 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0074419-0075648 the new ball or anything like that they're incredibly uncomfortable if you were one of the worst of the different things you will pay someone to replace my days after years of use words on one side by side 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0075648-0077665 the weather changes the size of the shopkeepers if you want something easy thing to realize that you will acquire shepherds why he was so widespread support you want to stress that the party would pay for a bollywood my jaw dropped after a crisis what kind of a new study your car 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078109-0078372 he had no idea what that was 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078372-0079678 so i said well we're trying to always think she's a network of supporters was the best thing she said whatever and i'd be better all his choice made it possible for me to do better 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0079678-0080552 but i felt which wine or a whole book to try to squeeze to myself 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0080992-0082076 the reason i felt worse is that we have all these options available my expectations about how to repair changing the way up 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0082076-0083475 i had very little to no particular expectations for the weekend was later when i came home fires that a woman should understand why there was good but wasn't perfect and so i compare what i got all excited 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0083475-0084041 when i was disappointed that wasn't what i expected any options to people's lives 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0084041-0085502 it hopes to increase the expectations people have about how to those options will be aware that contributions were satisfied with what results the weather conditions nobody in the world of marketing noses 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085502-0085781 but if they did 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085781-0086326 you will know what this is about the truth is more like this 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0086674-0087775 the reason that everything was better than when everything was worse is that when everything was of course it was actually possible for people to have experiences that worked as a surprise 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0087775-0088887 nowadays the world we live in a way that would industrialize citizens with perfection expectation that she can ever hope for is that was supposed to be just the ticket 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0088887-0090231 you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations were expectations about the group the secret to happiness as we're talking for synthetic happiness is low expectations 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0091167-0092769 i would say just one of them will fire at the moment that i actually went to hawaii and which is really quite wonderful i could have done better in itself but so is the most vexing problem 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0092769-0094116 one consequence of the idea that encourages when there's only one kind of like is that when you were dissatisfied and was widely as possible this rescue the world's richest what would you do 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0094116-0095401 when there are hundreds of diversity is available and you by one that's disappointing u.s. wireless as possible is equally if we are to be asked the question is you 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0095401-0096794 you could have done better with about one hundred different ideas on display there's no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even more voters also decisions for what they feel disappointed 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0096794-0099151 a battle between themselves clinical depression has exploded in industry worldwide generation i believe is significant calculated a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experienced as disappointing as educators is alive and then what happens when the disgraced themselves they think they are at fault 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099151-0099870 and so the net result is that we do better at home in general objectively we feel worse 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099870-0100615 so let me remind you this is essential for what we all tend to be true 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0100615-0101431 it all falls is not true there's no question that some choices entertainment 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0101431-0102631 but that doesn't format and more choices better than some chose this a medical marijuana is utterly confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0102631-0103651 well for now is a policy marathon is a policy that are the thing to think about is what enables all this choice 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0103651-0104500 the biggest societies is that your levels there are lots of places in the world we've heard about several of them 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0104500-0105476 well the problem is not that they have too much choice their problems that they have trouble so this i'm talking about is the peculiar problem either 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0105483-0106567 at ford western societies was so frustrated during this is the one that got yesterday about how expensive and difficult ones so 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0106690-0107078 his constituency both hope 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0107078-0108308 it's a waste of money what i'm telling you is that these expensive complicated choices is not simply the tabletop that we heard that we may get worse 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0108308-0109445 or if someone makes people in our society to make all the choices we make more shifted to societies in which people have too few options 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0109445-0110503 now one of those people i speak truth to power could be improved also is what economists call prego turned into income redistribution can make everyone 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0110503-0111279 there was just work because of the whole structure which is so to conclude 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0111279-0112192 this country is cartoon and a sophisticated person say what is just to show you know that it is possible that before 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0112295-0113151 in part the imagination myopic view of the world and that's where the first with obama however the more i came to the view that is 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0113151-0114308 this notion that the truth of the matter is that if you share a fishbowl so that anything is possible you have freedom you have grounds 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0114308-0115008 if you share this is also that everything is possible you decrease satisfaction 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115008-0115842 you increase paralysis and decrease satisfaction everybody's official this one is culturally two women 
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115842-0116905 perhaps even for the fish germany france and the absence of some of the forty fourth recipe for misery and i suspect that thank you very much

BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007-0001572-0002425 this is the foundation for science and technology that will determine the success of the opposition opens up your goal but this is the driving
