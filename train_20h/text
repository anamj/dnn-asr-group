911Mothers_2010W-0008655-0009118 and the u s government called for a death penalty for him if convicted
911Mothers_2010W-0028886-0029141 all the women all the mothers
911Mothers_2010W-0042062-0042931 with support with help from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation and aicha started and she said
911Mothers_2010W-0052717-0053290 a couple of words for conclusion because our time is up
AJJacobs_2007P-0011468-0012407 and it was about the year i spent reading the encyclopedia britannica from a to z in my quest to learn everything in the world or more precisely from
AJJacobs_2007P-0023843-0024988 jewish bibles a friend of mine sent me something called a hip hop bible where the twenty three rd psalm is rendered as the lord is all that as opposed to what i knew it as the lord is my shepherd
AJJacobs_2007P-0035833-0036382 were particularly challenging the first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day
AJJacobs_2007P-0046379-0047397 i was able to stone one adulterer it happened i was in the park and i was dressed in my biblical clothing sandals and a white robe you know because again the outer
AJJacobs_2007P-0058284-0058979 very very clear early on because if you do then you end up acting like a crazy person and stoning adulterers or here
AJJacobs_2007P-0070225-0070834 that i didn't even notice that i took for granted as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong
AJJacobs_2007P-0082904-0083420 words in the bible which are the ones that jesus spoke that's how they printed them in the old bibles and
AJJacobs_2007P-0097041-0097942 i failed miserably because you can't you have to pick and choose and anyone who follows the bible is going to be picking and choosing the key is
AJJacobs_2011P-0005654-0005977 it had its downsides
AJJacobs_2011P-0024646-0025117 so i finished and it was a success
AJJacobs_2011P-0041043-0042969 they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate so without noise reduction technology our country would not exist so as a patriot i felt it was important to i wear all the earplugs and the earphones
AaronHuey_2010X-0004862-0005878 now if any of you have ever heard of aim the american indian movement or of russell means or leonard peltier or of the stand off at oglala
AaronHuey_2010X-0021835-0022227 sixty six the beginning of the transcontinental railroad a new era
AaronHuey_2010X-0049858-0050814 the holy man black elk said i did not know then how much was ended when i look back now from this high hill of my old age
AaronHuey_2010X-0074552-0075336 the last chapter in any successful genocide is the one in which the oppressor can remove their hands and say
AaronHuey_2010X-0087611-0088374 or church trip to paint some graffiti covered houses or a suburban family donating a box of clothes they don't even want anymore
AaronKoblin_2011-0013755-0015449 so zooming back out real quick we see again the u s you get florida down in the right hand corner moving across to the west coast you see san francisco and los angeles big low traffic zones across nevada and arizona and that's us down there in l a and long beach on the bottom
AaronKoblin_2011-0030008-0030214 lots of sheep
AaronKoblin_2011-0048027-0049310 this is again showing all the different contributions you see some people did beautiful stipple renderings like this one on top spent a long time making realistic versions and other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces here
AaronKoblin_2011-0076719-0077971 a series of images so what we did was cross cut a bunch of archival footage of johnny cash and at eight frames a second we allowed individuals to draw a single frame that would get woven into this dynamically changing music video
AaronOConnell_2011-0005681-0007153 and so i consider myself one of these people along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas but at the same time we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work
AaronOConnell_2011-0020872-0021370 that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition
AaronOConnell_2011-0042003-0043021 there's one more part to the story it's when we warmed it up and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece
AbigailWashburn_2012U-0023967-0024330 and everybody's eyes just pop wide open like it's going to
AbrahamVerghese_2011G-0004311-0004671 and the cat scan revealed no blood clots in the lung
AbrahamVerghese_2011G-0020938-0021474 and he says and did you take the shortcut down inverleith row to get here to the infirmary
AbrahamVerghese_2011G-0046009-0047882 taken by the physician who held vigil at the bedside for two three nights that he decided that he would try and depict the physician in our time almost a tribute to this physician and hence the painting the doctor a very famous painting it's been on calendars postage stamps in many different countries i've often wondered
AbrahamVerghese_2011G-0059741-0060004 the cancer center was wonderful it had a
AbrahamVerghese_2011G-0065074-0066925 i was very influenced by that anecdote i was also influenced by another experience that i had again when i was in texas before i moved to stanford i had a reputation as being interested in patients with chronic fatigue this is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy
AbrahamVerghese_2011G-0072815-0073998 i was able to do a thorough physical because i had nothing else to do i like to think that i do a thorough physical exam but because the whole visit was now about the physical i could do an extraordinarily thorough exam
AbrahamVerghese_2011G-0082151-0082493 and i always felt that if my patient
AbrahamVerghese_2011G-0093413-0093957 i remember every time i went to a patient's deathbed whether in the hospital
AbrahamVerghese_2011G-0104583-0105717 no this ritual was about the one message that physicians have needed to convey to their patients although god knows of late in our hubris we seem to have drifted away we seem to have forgotten
AdamDavidson_2012S-0012690-0013538 it's supporting or attacking people say we should call it the fiscal slope or we should call it an austerity crisis but then other people say no that's even more partisan
AdamDavidson_2012S-0029344-0029861 when i picture how republicans see the economy what i picture is
AdamDavidson_2012S-0045347-0045909 when you look at how the federal government spends money so this is the battle right here
AdamDavidson_2012S-0059044-0060674 i should also note that the discretionary spending which is about nineteen percent of the budget that is democratic and republican issues so you do have welfare food stamps other programs that tend to be popular among democrats but you also have the farm bill and all sorts of department of interior inducements for
AdamDavidson_2012S-0071543-0072967 but on these fiscal issues these important fiscal issues we just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say and in fact there's this other group of people who are not as divided as people might think and that group is economists
AdamDavidson_2012S-0088526-0089153 they pick and choose they see compromise and they change over time when they hear a better argument or a worse argument
AdamDavidson_2012S-0098196-0099078 and that gets me back to the dollar and it gets me back to reminding myself that we know this experience we know what it's like
AdamDavidson_2012S-0113408-0115289 so i'm in the media i feel like my job to make this happen is to help foster the things that seem to lead to compromise to not talk about this in those vague and scary terms that do polarize us but to just talk about it like what it is not an existential crisis not some
AdamGarone_2011X-0018131-0018445 hated it parents would shuffle kids away from
AdamGarone_2011X-0034263-0034653 so from that day forward my life has become about a mustache
AdamGarone_2011X-0051007-0051459 mustaches all across canada raising awareness and funds for your organization
AdamGarone_2011X-0067759-0068250 now what i want to share with you is one of my most touching
AdamGarone_2011X-0077501-0078657 survivor support programs and research now we always focus naturally on how much we raise because it's a very tangible outcome but for me awareness and education
AdamGarone_2011X-0086911-0088320 research we fund prostate cancer foundations now in thirteen countries we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions and researchers around the world and when we looked at this more recently
AdamGrosser_2007-0013138-0013716 so the great thing about two thousand and six is there's a lot of really great computational work you can do so we
AdamOckelford_2013X-0022538-0024066 has no one in the family who plays an instrument and yet he taught himself to play that and as you can see from the picture there was quite a lot of body action going on while you were playing derek now along derek and i met when he was four and a half years old
AdamOckelford_2013X-0081593-0081992 you may think thirteen hours is a long time to keep talking but derek does it effortlessly
AdamOstrow_2011G-0019685-0020601 now a lot of you are probably familiar with deb roy who back in march demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than ninety thousand hours of home video
AdamSadowsky_2010X-0003568-0004732 be showing the video at the end but before we do i want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted now when we first started talking to ok go the name of the song is this too shall pass
AdamSadowsky_2010X-0022413-0022431 okay
AdamSadowsky_2010X-0031724-0031939 what else planning is incredibly important
AdamSavage_2008P-0001757-0002498 the new yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of mauritius now the island of
AdamSavage_2008P-0011867-0012852 my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell and this was the very latest one so i began looking around for to see if anyone sold a
AdamSavage_2008P-0026943-0028106 i it's kind of like you know you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time you can't think about the totality i wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton i just noticed that as i finished this skull the armature wire that i had been used to holding it up
AdamSavage_2008P-0040477-0041357 it's not about it's not about the author it's not about the book or the movie or the story it's about the object in and of itself and in this case this object is
AdamSavage_2008P-0065259-0066140 this is by far the most accurate representation of the original maltese falcon than anyone has sculpted now the original one i should tell you is sculpted by a guy named fred sexton this is where
AdamSavage_2008P-0078012-0078459 later on tonight and you can a i want you to pick it
AdamSpencer_2013-0003268-0004766 humble breakfast radio announcer from sydney australia to be here on the ted stage literally on the other side of the world and i wanted to let you know a lot of the things you've heard about australians are true from the youngest of ages we display a prodigious sporting talent
AdamSpencer_2013-0018856-0019068 at the road map of life
AdamSpencer_2013-0032483-0033024 those five little twos multiplied together two five one equal thirty one
AdamSpencer_2013-0043414-0044430 thirty nine digits long proven to be prime in one thousand eight hundred and seventy six by a mathematician called lucas word up l dog
AdamSpencer_2013-0058428-0058619 it was the year i left university
AdamSpencer_2013-0076184-0076883 as confidently as we know the number seven is prime that fills me with
AdamSpencer_2013-0096275-0096793 where does it come from and he postulated a suggestion that there's this infinite
AditiShankardass_2009I-0003271-0004003 and there it was the seat of human consciousness the powerhouse of the human body sitting in my hands
AditiShankardass_2009I-0013157-0014046 looking at behavior alone can miss a vital piece of the puzzle and provide an incomplete or even a misleading picture of the child's problems
AditiShankardass_2009I-0026188-0026958 when we used this groundbreaking eeg technology to actually look at justin's brain the results were startling
AditiShankardass_2009I-0036977-0037556 and for too long these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation
AdoraSvitak_2010-0007418-0008491 the traits the word childish addresses are seen so often in adults that we should abolish this age discriminatory word when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility
AdoraSvitak_2010-0024594-0024766 true story by the way
AdoraSvitak_2010-0043879-0044482 because we are the leaders of tomorrow which means we're going to be taking care of you when you're old and senile no just kidding
AfraRaymond_2012X-0022810-0024394 it became so outrageous the whole situation that in fact a commission of inquiry was appointed and it reported in one thousand nine hundred and eighty two thirty years ago it reported the ballah report thirty years ago and immediately the government to government arrangements were stopped
AfraRaymond_2012X-0046844-0048563 being the kind of suspicious person i am i am outraged at that and i'm going to pause here i'm going to pause now and again and bring in different things i'm going to pause here and bring in something i saw in november last year at wall street i was at zuccotti park it was autumn it was cool it was damp it was getting dark
AfraRaymond_2012X-0071510-0073474 to check myself and recalculate my bearings and to go back into some of the work some of the stuff i'd written and some of the exchanges i'd had with the officials to see what was really what as we say in trinidad and tobago who is who and what is what okay we want to try to recalculate and i made a freedom of information application in
AfraRaymond_2012X-0096530-0097443 i have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country's history it's also the single largest example of public corruption according to this equation
AimeeMullins_1998-0007273-0007459 and i've been there for four years love it
AimeeMullins_1998-0017108-0017129 and
AimeeMullins_1998-0024985-0025142 ran one race and i
AimeeMullins_1998-0041311-0042023 kind of pistoning in the socket and at about eighty five meters of my one hundred meters sprint in all my glory i
AimeeMullins_1998-0052157-0053153 a year ago i got out on a gravel track and couldn't run fifty meters and so here i am never lost i set new records at the u s nationals the olympic trials that may
AimeeMullins_1998-0070471-0070895 you have one minute and when i was putting my blocks in
AimeeMullins_1998-0089878-0089904 he
AimeeMullins_1998-0104050-0104282 so these are the sprint legs and i can put my other
AimeeMullins_2009U-0003384-0004681 only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way and maybe censors that natural curiosity or you know reins in the question asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids
AimeeMullins_2009U-0013865-0014355 some of you actually saw me at ted eleven years ago and
AimeeMullins_2009U-0024254-0025093 and it really opened my eyes to this conversation that could be explored about beauty what does a beautiful woman have to look like
AimeeMullins_2009U-0037113-0037731 with a potato root system growing in them and beetroots out the top and a very lovely brass toe that's a good close up of that one
AimeeMullins_2009U-0051092-0051766 it can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space
AimeeMullins_2009U-0058009-0058202 and all the potential within it
AlGore_2006-0013403-0013597 this was a rented ford taurus
AlGore_2006-0037624-0038690 show some new images and i'm going to recapitulate just four or five now the slide show i update the slide show
AlGore_2006-0052808-0054049 to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe not quite there yet ok now what can you do
AlGore_2006-0066142-0066985 and by the time the movie comes out in may this will be updated to two point zero and we will have click through purchases of offsets
AlGore_2006-0074230-0074464 and it comes out in may
AlGore_2006-0077720-0078570 for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse in communities all across the country and we're
AlGore_2006-0091285-0091586 but again those of you who are good at branding i need your help on this
AlGore_2008-0021147-0021423 that military conflicts are typically
AlGore_2008-0104794-0105044 about the value of
AlGore_2008-0112768-0112989 another that ended slavery
AlGore_2008-0121932-0122243 that is worthy of our best efforts
AlGore_2008-0132813-0133178 when you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now i mean
AlGore_2008-0142535-0143272 the richness and fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold
AlGore_2008-0152473-0153007 connect with people become very active as citizens have a moratorium we shouldn't have any new
AlGore_2008-0161067-0161504 we can change things but we have to actively change
AlSeckel_2004-0007223-0008481 can violate your expectations in a pleasing way i mean sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant but i'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way in a very primal way so i can make the audience here happy
AlSeckel_2004-0016194-0016349 and we can violate your
AlSeckel_2004-0030424-0030455 it's
AlSeckel_2004-0037542-0037733 now let's take a static image
AlSeckel_2004-0045411-0046327 now interestingly enough i get a lot of emails from people who say is there any perceptual difference between males and females
AlSeckel_2004-0054875-0055135 i hope you will enjoy we have one here
AlSeckel_2004-0064653-0064985 and of course since happiness we want joy to the world
AlSeckel_2004-0071152-0071256 to violinist
AlSeckel_2004-0077384-0077689 john cederquist does these wonderful trompe
AlSeckel_2004-0086355-0086530 see me outside i'd be happy to show you
AlVernacchio_2012-0011898-0012215 if there's grass on the field play ball
AlVernacchio_2012-0024017-0024189 when you're hungry
AlVernacchio_2012-0037079-0037323 and that means there's always a loser in baseball
AlaindeBotton_2009G-0001415-0002333 these career crises often actually on a sunday evening just as the sun is starting to set and the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality
AlaindeBotton_2009G-0014688-0015590 love in general respect they are willing to accord us that will be strictly defined by our position in the social hierarchy and that's a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers
AlaindeBotton_2009G-0022313-0023526 along with that is a kind of spirit of equality we're all basically equal there are no strictly defined kind of hierarchies there is one really big problem with this and that problem is envy envy
AlaindeBotton_2009G-0029783-0030545 that you would nowadays become as rich and famous as bill gates as it was unlikely in the seventeenth century that you would accede to the ranks of the french aristocracy
AlaindeBotton_2009G-0045393-0046031 and some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally the own their success but they also
AlaindeBotton_2009G-0059775-0061129 also according them a level of sympathy which ordinary life would not necessarily accord them i remember a few years ago i was thinking about all this and i went to see the sunday sport a tabloid newspaper that i don't recommend you to start reading if you're not familiar with it already
AlaindeBotton_2009G-0071018-0071858 a natural force the universe whatever it is something else that is being worshiped we've slightly lost the habit of doing that which is i think why we're particularly drawn to nature
AlaindeBotton_2009G-0085369-0086364 even worse to have an idea of what it is you want and find out at the end of a journey that it isn't in fact what you wanted all along so i'm going to end it there but
AlaindeBotton_2011G-0002431-0004362 and the atheists and for the last decade or so it's been quite clear what being an atheist means there have been some very vocal atheists who've pointed out not just that religion is wrong but that it's ridiculous these people many of whom have lived in north oxford
AlaindeBotton_2011G-0021681-0023525 interesting where it came from in the early nineteenth century church attendance in western europe started sliding down very very sharply and people panicked they asked themselves the following question they said where are people going to find the morality where are they going to find guidance and where are they going to find sources of consolation
AlaindeBotton_2011G-0034900-0035138 i'm an independent individual person
AlaindeBotton_2011G-0040177-0040981 so religions are cultures of repetition they circle the great truths again and again and again we associate repetition with boredom give us the new we're always saying
AlaindeBotton_2011G-0048538-0050079 but if you're a zen buddhist in the middle of september you will be ordered out of your home made to stand on a canonical platform and made to celebrate the festival of tsukimi where you will be given poems to read in honor of the moon and the passage of time and the frailty of life that it should remind us of you'll be handed rice cakes
AlaindeBotton_2011G-0066309-0066698 but if we're serious people we don't admit to that but that feeling of puzzlement
AlaindeBotton_2011G-0077486-0078603 and they don't really change much now think about religions think about organized religions what do organized religions do they group together they form institutions and that has all sorts of advantages
AlaindeBotton_2011G-0090049-0091607 so really my concluding point is you may not agree with religion but at the end of the day religions are so subtle so complicated so intelligent in many ways that they're not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone they're for all of us thank you very much
AlaindeBotton_2011G-0114971-0115150 thank you for sparking
AlanKay_2007-0007823-0008973 not only are we fools in the pejorative sense but that we're easily fooled in fact what shakespeare was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled so we're actually looking forward to it
AlanKay_2007-0014590-0014783 rotate this little guy around and
AlanKay_2007-0023088-0023644 somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws we can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel
AlanKay_2007-0032880-0033259 another name for them could be architecture as a metaphor
AlanKay_2007-0041604-0041908 without removing what's important about the data
AlanKay_2007-0050524-0050781 so a kid who's fourteen in high school
AlanKay_2007-0058165-0059436 was a kindergarten and first grade teacher but was a natural mathematician so she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music but is a terrific musician she just had a feeling for math and
AlanKay_2007-0066750-0067195 and the total was nine on that one and then the next one so she saw right away that
AlanKay_2007-0075201-0075757 do i'm using the software that we're putting on the one hundred dollar laptop
AlanKay_2007-0091659-0091718 not
AlanKay_2007-0106622-0106825 the ball and run the movie at the same time
AlanKay_2007-0114977-0115739 but in fact if you think of it children are the future we send to the future forget about messages children are the future
AlanRussell_2006-0001412-0002090 you today about hopefully converting fear into hope when we go to the physician
AlanRussell_2006-0013682-0013837 as you were at the beginning of the
AlanRussell_2006-0028014-0028982 to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this this is age versus cost of health care and you can see that right around
AlanRussell_2006-0038811-0039488 and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease
AlanRussell_2006-0049223-0050346 and to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus a mammalian fetus if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy will re grow that
AlanRussell_2006-0063574-0064979 however for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends the lights are down this is a good time to look at your feet check your blackberry do anything other than look at the screen what i'm about to show you
AlanRussell_2006-0076949-0078272 this is happening today this is clinically relevant today there are materials which do this there are the heart patches but could you go a little further could you say instead of using material can i take some cells along with the material
AlanRussell_2006-0088036-0088378 the coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early
AlanRussell_2006-0100178-0100822 and that bio reactor will lay down in the wound bed the gun that you see there sprays cells
AlanRussell_2006-0114739-0116006 and at the end of a very testy meeting what the nih director said is your vision is larger than our appetite i'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision but together we can change his appetite thank
AlanSiegel_2010-0013390-0014176 but it's going to work it's more effective than just computational aids and what about terms like over the limit
AlannaShaikh_2012G-0002799-0004715 now he's really pretty sick he needs help eating he needs help getting dressed he doesn't really know where he is or when it is and it's been really really hard my dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life and i've spent the last decade watching him disappear
AlannaShaikh_2012G-0016210-0016423 let's start with the hobbies
AlannaShaikh_2012G-0027624-0028255 a lot of people don't know that alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms as well as cognitive symptoms
AlastairParvin_2013-0004765-0004924 the economy ran out of jobs
AlastairParvin_2013-0016914-0017981 and i want to offer three slightly counterintuitive ideas for how it might be done the first is i think we need to question this idea that architecture is about making buildings
AlastairParvin_2013-0026418-0028179 actually we've got ourselves locked into this industrial era mindset which says that the only people who can make cities are large organizations or corporations who build on our behalf procuring whole neighborhoods in single monolithic projects and of course form follows finance
AlastairParvin_2013-0034763-0035449 and the problem is that up until now it was the monetary economy which had all the infrastructure and all the tools
AlastairParvin_2013-0046269-0046633 they can generate a set of cutting files which allow them in effect
AlastairParvin_2013-0061946-0063550 we shared the whole of wikihouse under a creative commons license and now what's just beginning to happen is that groups around the world are beginning to take it and use it and hack it and tinker with it and it's amazing there's a cool group over in christchurch in new zealand looking at post earthquake development housing
AlastairParvin_2013-0073368-0073616 a kind of wikipedia for stuff
AlbertoCairo_2011X-0009330-0010417 i found myself in a strange situation i felt not quite ready for that job there was so much to learn
AlbertoCairo_2011X-0029176-0030881 the center is closed no staff around maybe the machinery is broken who is going to make the legs for him so i hoped that he would not come this is the streets of kabul
AlbertoCairo_2011X-0052116-0053310 we could not possibly stay indoors with all these sandbags at the windows very sad dark so we chose a small spot in the garden
AlbertoCairo_2011X-0070489-0072391 and he said i ask for a job and then he added something i will never forget for the rest of my life he said i am a scrap of a man
AlbertoCairo_2011X-0085594-0087492 and then i asked for verification it was true the comment of najmuddin was mahmoud has something to prove i understood that i was wrong again mahmoud had looked taller i remember him sitting behind the workbench
AlexLaskey_2013-0005106-0006906 and even we aren't paying attention to the energy use that's driving climate change the woman in the photo with me is harriet we met her on our first family vacation harriet's paying attention to her energy use and she is decidedly not an energy geek this is the story of how harriet came to pay attention
AlexLaskey_2013-0012795-0012997 and start wasting less of it
AlexLaskey_2013-0023763-0024606 just like those effective door hangers we have people comparing themselves to their neighbors and then we give everyone targeted recommendations to help them save
AlexLaskey_2013-0035838-0036343 but the most overlooked resource to get us to a sustainable energy future it isn't on this slide
AlexLaskey_2013-0046248-0046451 and still i know there must be more
AlexSteffen_2005G-0014235-0015235 and those kids are growing up in a completely different way than their parents did no matter where they live they've been exposed to this idea of our society of our prosperity
AlexSteffen_2005G-0025610-0026441 and given that i have thirteen minutes to do this this is going to go kind of quick so i don't know just stick with me right so first of all what are we looking for bright green city
AlexSteffen_2005G-0033661-0034347 that are much more comfortable than standard buildings use all natural light etc and over time cost less
AlexSteffen_2005G-0040309-0041412 how we build things can change as well this is a bio morphic building it takes its inspiration in form from life many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful and also
AlexSteffen_2005G-0060125-0061779 this is a pretty remarkable program using free and open source software cheap sort of hacked together machines and basically sort of abandoned buildings has put together a bunch of community centers where people can come in get high speed internet access learn computer programming skills
AlexSteffen_2005G-0076796-0077313 into a whole new way of global collaboration i would keep your eye on this fellow
AlexSteffen_2005G-0093291-0093618 which pumps water as kids play
AlexSteffen_2011G-0010265-0012261 in order to provide the kind of energy that it would take for eight billion people living in cities that are even somewhat like the cities that those of us in the global north live in today we would have to generate an absolutely astonishing amount of energy it may be possible that we are not even able to build that much clean energy
AlexSteffen_2011G-0028294-0029876 but the reality is that by and large what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions is a threshold effect where people simply stop driving as much and increasingly more and more people if they're surrounded by places that make them feel at home give up their cars altogether
AlexSteffen_2011G-0044787-0045583 buildings are becoming bundles of services so we have new designs that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on
AlexSteffen_2011G-0058350-0059492 and if we have another eight billion or seven billion or six billion even people living on a planet where their cities also steal the future we're going to run out of future really fast
AlexTabarrok_2009-0006239-0007159 trade walls began to come tumbling down here are some data on tariffs starting at forty percent coming down to less than five percent we globalized the world
AlexTabarrok_2009-0012764-0013601 and perhaps most remarkably at the beginning of the twenty first century really for the first time in modern history
AlexTabarrok_2009-0026138-0027087 now this is not new this is practically not new to tedsters this is practically the model of ted what is new is that the greater function of ideas
AlexTabarrok_2009-0035623-0036817 as other countries become richer the demand for these pharmaceuticals is going to increase tremendously and that means an increase incentive to do research and development which benefits everyone in the world
AlexTabarrok_2009-0046830-0047952 it is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader because for too long the united states and a handful of other developed countries have shouldered the entire burden of research and development
AlexTabarrok_2009-0061211-0061541 century than you expect to see in a year today
AlexTabarrok_2009-0074785-0075430 and there is some truth to this in the sense that we have something of a finite resource and
AlexTabarrok_2009-0086341-0086453 thank you
AlexaMeade_2013G-0020106-0020275 the last time i'd painted
AlexaMeade_2013G-0031314-0031733 and the images were always completely unexpected in the end
AlexaMeade_2013G-0038368-0039836 to tripping over a shadow and then turning people into paintings and painting on people in a pool of milk but then again i guess it's also not unforeseeable that you can find the strange in the familiar
AlexanderTsiaras_2010P-0037989-0039694 of the body these little pieces of tissue that were a trophoblast coming off of a blastocyst all of a sudden burrowing itself into the side of the uterus saying i'm here to stay all of a sudden having conversation and communications with the estrogens the progesterones saying i'm here to stay plant
AlexanderTsiaras_2010P-0051490-0052917 so as you actually watch the baby's brain grow and this is one of the things that we're doing right now we're actually doing the launch of two new studies of actually scanning babies brains from the moment they're born every six months until they're six years old we're going to be doing actually to about two hundred and fifty children
AlexisOhanian_2009I-0018346-0019192 was even more important was the fact that they actually accomplished their mission the japanese government called off their whaling expedition mission accomplished greenpeace was thrilled the whales were happy that's a quote
AliCarrChellman_2010X-0007731-0008538 some really nice statistics for example for every one hundred girls that are suspended from school there are two hundred and fifty boys that are suspended from school
AliCarrChellman_2010X-0013532-0014322 that salaries are still significantly lower even when controlled for job types and that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years
AliCarrChellman_2010X-0024257-0024773 there are three reasons that i believe that boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today
AliCarrChellman_2010X-0036056-0036408 it's not okay to write these kinds of things in classrooms today
AliCarrChellman_2010X-0050645-0051742 the teacher's salary depends on no child left behind and race to the top and accountability and testing and all of this so she has to figure out a way
AliCarrChellman_2010X-0062791-0063598 the new york times just talked about a school recently a game designer from the new school put together a wonderful video gaming school
AliceDreger_2011X-0004472-0004963 and in the other case the sperm is carrying an x chromosome meeting the x chromosome of the egg
AliceDreger_2011X-0018351-0019318 females like males have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands they're in the back of our body and the adrenal glands make androgens which are a masculinizing hormone
AliceDreger_2011X-0037023-0037436 and i had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test in fact
AliceDreger_2011X-0050613-0051576 makes me tense and it makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy so in order to tell you about that tension i have to first admit to you that i'm a huge fan of the founding fathers
AliceDreger_2011X-0067964-0069178 next came the successful civil rights movement where we found people like sojourner truth talking about ain't i a woman we find men on the marching lines of the civil rights movement saying i
AliceDreger_2011X-0083460-0084209 it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude well we have to draw the line somewhere so we will draw the line somewhere
AliceDreger_2011X-0092618-0093133 i'm not sure where we go what i do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of
AliceDreger_2011X-0101401-0102617 now for years because i've been interested in intersex i've also been interested in sex difference research and one of the things that i've been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world
AlisaMiller_2008-0002717-0003158 and here's how news shapes what americans see
AlisaMiller_2008-0012857-0013157 so why don't we hear more about the world
AlisaMiller_2008-0024461-0024955 what we want for americans in our increasingly interconnected world
AlisonGopnik_2011G-0031073-0031398 who's learned how to use a tool to get food
AlisonGopnik_2011G-0057329-0057676 mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now
AlisonGopnik_2011G-0088898-0089102 this is actually pretty typical of four year
AlisonJackson_2005G-0088947-0089720 the real person which is highly embarrassing i've also been working with the guardian on a topical basis a page a week
AllanJones_2011G-0014166-0015396 you can see areas where neuronal cell bodies are being stained and what you can see is it's very non uniform you see a lot more structure there so the outer part of that brain is the neocortex it's one continuous
AllanJones_2011G-0030723-0031204 and we're very careful about the brains that we do take
AllanJones_2011G-0048040-0048856 and that tissue falls off you can see on the microscope slide here that's what's happening in real time there's a container underneath that's collecting that tissue
AllanJones_2011G-0057782-0059513 so here's the modalities that we put together you'll start to recognize these things from what we've collected before here's the mr it provides the framework there's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn it allows you to zoom in it allows you to highlight individual structures but most importantly
AllanJones_2011G-0076267-0077898 and i think every human we all have different genetic backgrounds we all have lived separate lives but the fact is our genomes are greater than ninety nine percent similar we're similar at the genetic level
AllanSavory_2013-0002628-0003351 this perfect storm is mounting a grim reality increasingly grim reality
AllanSavory_2013-0010919-0011424 we have environments where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year
AllanSavory_2013-0020037-0020656 when we damage soils you give off carbon carbon goes back to the atmosphere
AllanSavory_2013-0028070-0029242 and so i grew up hating livestock because of the damage they were doing and then my university education as an ecologist reinforced my beliefs
AllanSavory_2013-0034379-0035478 now no livestock were involved but suspecting that we had too many elephants now i did the research and i proved we had too many
AllanSavory_2013-0042420-0043137 and i found that american scientists had no explanation for this except that it is arid and natural
AllanSavory_2013-0055722-0056708 now the main defense against pack hunting predators is to get into herds and the larger the herd the safer the individuals
AllanSavory_2013-0065828-0066319 and we are burning in africa every single year
AllanSavory_2013-0082119-0082403 clearly more was needed than bunching and moving
AllanSavory_2013-0093789-0095054 the production of grass shrubs trees wildlife everything is now more productive and we have virtually no fear of dry years
AllanSavory_2013-0108049-0109083 really mimicking nature now with planned grazing and they have documented a fifty percent increase in the production of the land in the first year
AllanSavory_2013-0119295-0120042 we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere and safely store it in the grassland soils
AllisonHunt_2007-0009806-0010240 the table i'm gonna replace your hip it's about an eighteen month wait
AllisonHunt_2007-0019374-0020423 they needed some young blood so next thing you know i had my bright blue volunteer vest i had my photo id and i was fully trained by my eighty nine year old boss i worked alone
AllisonHunt_2007-0027467-0027661 they do it in a way that benefits society
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I-0033031-0033771 i just put the paper on the focal length which was an etching print then i got the portrait of the sun from sunlight
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I-0063891-0064939 the process to get to make the sculpture was interesting because i wrote to balsara who produces that air freshener called odonil saying dear sir i am an artist this is my catalogue will you help me to make this sculpture
AlwarBalasubramaniam_2009I-0092864-0094647 on the gallery wall it's a false wall which contains like one hundred and ten cubic feet so that hole actually makes the air come out and go in so where it's happening we can see but what is happening will remain invisible only this is from the show called invisible at talwar gallery this is called kaayam
AmandaPalmer_2013-0018713-0020043 connection with people because i loved it so after all of our shows we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people and we made an art out of asking people to help us
AmandaPalmer_2013-0032397-0032599 these people have so little
AmandaPalmer_2013-0043084-0043579 and meanwhile my band is becoming bigger and bigger we signed with a major label
AmandaPalmer_2013-0049288-0050230 after my own gigs but i have to physically stand there and take the help from people and unlike the guy in the opening band i've actually had a lot of practice standing there
AmandaPalmer_2013-0062542-0063054 and this hurt in a really familiar way and people saying
AmandaPalmer_2013-0069041-0069244 musicians artists
AmandaPalmer_2013-0077901-0078101 and i think when we really
AmberCase_2010W-0015374-0016319 and so you have to be careful about leaving your front lawn open which is basically your facebook wall so that people don't write on it in the middle of the night because it's very much the equivalent
AmberCase_2010W-0032475-0032983 and so what happens is when we bring all that into the social space we end up checking our phones all the time
AmiKlin_2011X-0002902-0004638 as a scientist i always wanted to measure that resonance that sense of the other that happens so quickly in the blink of an eye we intuit other people's feelings we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen
AmiKlin_2011X-0021372-0021832 think about autism as something that
AmiKlin_2011X-0029454-0029733 this is a little
AmiKlin_2011X-0034990-0035729 and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you and that is considered to be a signal
AmiKlin_2011X-0053872-0054311 and those services can cost in excess of sixty to eighty thousand dollars a year
AmiKlin_2011X-0069364-0069698 we are very interested in those first two years of
AmiKlin_2011X-0091302-0092221 they start over here they love people's eyes and it remains quite stable it sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months
AmiKlin_2011X-0111100-0112085 we can do a great deal of things and the idea is not to cure autism that's not the idea what we want is to make sure
AmitSood_2011-0017765-0018247 went in and i started noticing that these kids were actually beating something
AmitSood_2011-0031375-0031812 is did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum
AmoryLovins_2005-0014853-0015358 oil and gas made from coal to which the whalers had not been paying attention
AmoryLovins_2005-0023570-0024703 will we in the united states continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars that seems to make more sense
AmoryLovins_2005-0031161-0033064 with a combination of advanced bio fuels and safe natural gas and that costs on average under eighteen dollars a barrel and compared with the official forecast that oil will cost twenty six dollars a barrel in two thousand and twenty five which is half of what we've been paying lately that will save seventy billion dollars a year starting quite soon
AmoryLovins_2005-0048217-0049734 in the airplane business it's again a similar story where the first twenty percent fuel saving is free as boeing is now demonstrating in its new dreamliner but then the next generation of planes saves about half
AmoryLovins_2005-0073660-0074914 each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel each of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist they snap together like a kid's toy
AmoryLovins_2005-0085410-0086425 or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance or if we used it as hydrogen which is more profitable and efficient we'd get rid of the domestic oil too
AmoryLovins_2005-0101967-0103460 then there's an important military role that in creating the move to high volume low cost commercial production of these kinds of materials or for that matter ultra light steels that are a good backup technology
AmoryLovins_2012S-0003672-0004072 could we have fuel without fear could we reinvent fire
AmoryLovins_2012S-0016211-0016381 and renewable supply
AmoryLovins_2012S-0027095-0028202 but also design and business strategy those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities
AmoryLovins_2012S-0043052-0044330 so vehicle fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next forty years but then also make electrification affordable and that
AmoryLovins_2012S-0056404-0057115 and combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes now on the drawing board can save close to a trillion dollars
AmoryLovins_2012S-0069771-0070991 can be made two thirds from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call institutional acupuncture we figure out where the
AmoryLovins_2012S-0081277-0082896 but as efficiency in buildings and industry starts to grow faster than the economy america's electricity use could actually shrink even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos
AmoryLovins_2012S-0097044-0097928 this is not about new technology it's just rearranging our metal furniture of course it also shrinks the pumping equipment and its capital costs
AmoryLovins_2012S-0106983-0107232 already in about twenty states
AmoryLovins_2012S-0120236-0120505 that is exactly why we've designed the grid
AmoryLovins_2012S-0132498-0133507 that approach is exactly what the pentagon is adopting for its own power supply they think they need that how about the rest of us that they're defending we want our stuff to work too
AmoryLovins_2012S-0141139-0141821 but with today's much better technologies more mature delivery channels and integrative design we can do
AmoryLovins_2012S-0149655-0150611 challenges climate change nuclear proliferation energy insecurity energy poverty all of which make us less safe
AmosWinter_2012X-0002110-0002972 but if you live in a country like the united states there's certain appurtenances available to you that do make life easier so if you're in a building you can take an elevator
AmosWinter_2012X-0020327-0020790 and effectively get a low gear and as they slide their hand down the lever
AmosWinter_2012X-0038033-0039960 and found it was terrible because we didn't get enough input from users so because we tested it with wheelchair users with wheelchair manufacturers we got that feedback from them not just articulating their problems but articulating their solutions and worked together to go back to the drawing board and make a new design which we brought back to east africa in nine
AmosWinter_2012X-0053934-0055092 but how do you get that bench level prototype to commercialization so we need gap fillers like continuum that can work on commercializing and we started a whole ngo to bring our chair to market global research innovation technology
AmyCuddy_2012G-0011216-0011849 obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior or body language but we call it nonverbals as social scientists
AmyCuddy_2012G-0029627-0029993 so the arms up in the v the chin is slightly lifted
AmyCuddy_2012G-0046566-0048202 it also goes both ways so when you feel powerful you're more likely to do this but it's also possible that when you pretend to be powerful you are more likely to actually feel powerful
AmyCuddy_2012G-0060615-0062352 and also that role changes can shape the mind so what happens okay you take a role change what happens if you do that at a really minimal level like this tiny manipulation this tiny intervention for two minutes you say i want you to stand like this and it's going to make you feel more powerful
AmyCuddy_2012G-0071077-0071731 from their baseline when they come in high power people experience about a twenty percent increase
AmyCuddy_2012G-0092628-0094024 people are bringing their true selves basically they're bringing themselves they bring their ideas but as themselves with no you know residue over them so this is what's driving the effect or mediating the effect so
AmyCuddy_2012G-0111525-0112016 and that was the moment for me because two things happened one was that i realized
AmyLockwood_2011G-0010112-0011268 joseph and christine who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them
AmySmith_2006-0002168-0003820 exciting that i'm working on but i think it's also the simplest it's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world it addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet the number one cause of death in children under five which is
AmySmith_2006-0018774-0019007 and in fact if you look closely
AmySmith_2006-0033085-0033418 now i'm going to take you to a different continent
AmySmith_2006-0041517-0042783 so we went back to mit we took out the instron machine and we figured out what sort of forces did you need in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it
AmySmith_2006-0049344-0049833 so this is where we're also moving ahead with our charcoal project and
AmySmith_2006-0066854-0068671 where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat i mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand and where when you work ten hours a day you're still only earning sixty dollars in a month
AmySmith_2006-0080702-0081166 this future and we need to start doing it now thank you
AmyTan_2008-0013654-0014588 or depression i do have to say somebody i read recently that van gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic that he might have had temporal lobe seizures
AmyTan_2008-0031382-0033021 my mother also believed that i would be next and she would be next and when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon you begin to think very much about everything you become very creative in a survival sense
AmyTan_2008-0049814-0050118 serendipitous way is no longer there
AmyTan_2008-0066390-0066990 that really disturbed me and led me to write a book called saving fish from drowning
AmyTan_2008-0079789-0080748 this moral response this feeling also i think one of the biggest things we are all looking at and we talked about today is genocide
AmyTan_2008-0096086-0096580 a discomfort i felt and then i knew that had to be the setting of my book
AmyTan_2008-0115559-0116315 you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world determining how things happen
AmyTan_2008-0128741-0129010 because then i will discover something new
AmyWebb_2013S-0012179-0013366 which was only four percent of the population so now i'm dealing with the possibility of thirty thousand men i was looking for somebody who was jewish because that's what i am and that was important to me that's only two point three percent of the population
AmyWebb_2013S-0028033-0028506 this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward
AmyWebb_2013S-0036655-0037796 i was not having a good night so i run home i call my mother i call my sister and as i do at the end of each one of these terrible terrible dates i regale them with the details
AmyWebb_2013S-0066865-0067190 who are all of the other women on these dating sites
AmyWebb_2013S-0083502-0084306 and as it turns out timing is also really really important just because you have access to somebody's mobile phone number or their instant message account
AmyWebb_2013S-0088446-0088624 and as it turns out
AmyWebb_2013S-0093235-0093394 which i thought was very clever
AnandAgarawala_2007-0007219-0007781 this is bumptop it's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing so you can bump things they're all physically
AnandAgarawala_2007-0021664-0022667 so you get that more traditional desktop things are kind of grid aligned more boring but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping and you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop
AnandaShankar_2009I-0035015-0036536 i focused on my mudras on the imagery of my dance on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself and slowly i moved out of that miserable state of mind
AnasAremeyawAnas_2013-0002633-0003004 i was a young reporter i had just come out of college
AnasAremeyawAnas_2013-0011513-0011681 it was about children
AnasAremeyawAnas_2013-0027842-0029230 if i say you have stolen i show you the evidence that you have stolen i show you how you stole it and when or what you used what you had stolen to do what is the essence of journalism if it doesn't benefit society
AnasAremeyawAnas_2013-0055201-0055430 toilet facilities very bad
AndersYnnerman_2010X-0007992-0008860 taken the liberty just for clarity to translate that to data slices that would correspond to about fifty mb of data which is small
AndersYnnerman_2010X-0021981-0023082 so this is where this little dear comes into play this is my daughter this is as of nine zero am this morning she's playing a computer game she's only two years old and she's having a blast
AndersYnnerman_2010X-0035157-0036407 and just by changing the functions then i can decide what's going to be transparent and what's going to be visible i can look at the skull structure and i can see that okay this is where they opened up the skull on this woman and that's where they went in
AndersYnnerman_2010X-0046025-0046992 and then the radiologist together with the pathologist and sometimes the forensic scientist looks at the data that's coming out and they have a joint session and then they decide what to do in the real physical
AndersYnnerman_2010X-0065057-0066408 okay now that we're talking about touch let me move on to really touching data and this is a bit of science fiction now so we're moving into really the future this is not really what the medical doctors are using right now but i hope they will in the future
AndersYnnerman_2010X-0077851-0078676 is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan the brain or any part of the body so what we're really getting out of this is information
AndersYnnerman_2010X-0092648-0093554 and we've been experimenting with this and i think this is a great application for the future of this technology because there's very little known about the animal anatomy
AndrasForgacs_2013G-0011844-0012552 clearly we cannot continue on this path which puts the environment public health and food
AndrasForgacs_2013G-0017344-0018911 ears windpipes skin blood vessels and bone that have been successfully implanted into patients and beyond medicine biofabrication can be a humane sustainable and scalable new industry
AndrasForgacs_2013G-0024043-0024818 if we can succeed here it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat closer on the horizon
AndrasForgacs_2013G-0039222-0040901 tune this leather for other desirable qualities like softness breathability durability elasticity and even things like pattern we can mimic nature but in some ways also improve upon it
AndrasForgacs_2013G-0051367-0052379 perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured thank you
AndreaGhez_2009G-0015871-0017211 at that point what's going to happen at that point gravity wins gravity wins over all other known forces and the object is forced to continue to collapse to an infinitely small object and then it's a black hole
AndreaGhez_2009G-0041496-0042979 and what we see is a line of stars and that is because we live in a galaxy which has a flattened disk like structure and we live in the middle of it so when we look towards the center we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy or line that defines the plane of the galaxy
AndreaGhez_2009G-0062219-0064075 now in the next few slides i'm just going to focus on that little square there so we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square although we've looked at all of them so i want to see how these things have moved and over the course of this experiment these stars have moved a tremendous amount so we've been doing this experiment for fifteen years and we see the stars go all the way around
AndreaGhez_2009G-0084555-0084925 so this is the fun part and in fact today this is what we're trying to figure out
AndreasSchleicher_2012G-0004510-0005141 look at how the world looked in the one thousand nine hundred and sixty s in terms of the proportion of people who had completed high school
AndreasSchleicher_2012G-0021973-0023592 this chart shows you the performance of countries in red sort of below oecd average yellow is so so and in green are the countries doing really well you can see shanghai korea singapore in asia finland in europe
AndreasSchleicher_2012G-0036848-0037824 what's behind the success of those systems but let's step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started pisa and i'm giving them a colored
AndreasSchleicher_2012G-0058700-0059678 not tax not other kinds of issues but education was the center of the public debate and then policymakers began to respond to this the federal government
AndreasSchleicher_2012G-0077419-0079165 and of course the question is can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere of course you can't copy and paste education systems wholesale but these comparisons have identified a range of factors that high performing systems share
AndreasSchleicher_2012G-0093730-0094979 and nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers high performing systems are very careful in how they recruit and select their teachers and how they train
AndreasSchleicher_2012G-0106060-0106449 of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools
AndresLozano_2013X-0003636-0005111 so as i said neurosurgery comes from a long tradition it's been around for about seven thousand years in mesoamerica there used to be neurosurgery and there were these neurosurgeons that used to treat patients
AndresLozano_2013X-0014691-0015835 now the manifestation of this depends on where in the brain these neurons are so when these neurons are in the motor circuit you get dysfunction in the movement system and you get things like parkinson's disease
AndresLozano_2013X-0020054-0020737 the circuitry of the brain to implant electrodes and turning areas of the brain up and down to see if we can help our patients
AndresLozano_2013X-0028208-0028395 so this looks something like this
AndresLozano_2013X-0044154-0044654 back in israel where he lives three months after the procedure and here he is
AndresLozano_2013X-0061975-0062958 so now we are in clinical trials and are in phase iii clinical trials and this may become a new procedure if it's safe and we find that it's effective to treat patients with severe depression
AndresLozano_2013X-0082945-0084324 so the message i want to leave you with today is that indeed there are several circuits in the brain that are malfunctioning across various disease states whether we're talking about parkinson's disease depression schizophrenia
AndrewBird_2010-0051441-0051875 and it's like your eyes start straining to see themselves
AndrewBlum_2012G-0008884-0009769 and what was even more striking to me and what i really got hung up on was that the world inside the screen seemed to have no physical reality of its own
AndrewBlum_2012G-0023006-0024898 and i was embarrassed i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for the internet was that amorphous blob or it was a silly black box with a blinking red light on it it wasn't a real world out there but in fact it is there is a real world of the internet out there and that's what i spent about two years visiting these places of the internet
AndrewBlum_2012G-0038772-0039955 and then they connect to the continent somewhere they connect in a manhole like this literally this is where the five thousand mile cable plugs in this is in halifax a cable that stretches from halifax to ireland
AndrewBlum_2012G-0060317-0061159 and then once that cable was on shore they began to prepare to connect it to the other side for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station
AndrewMcAfee_2012X-0005135-0006306 and some other economic indicators also started to rebound and they got kind of healthy kind of quickly corporate profits are quite high in fact if you include bank profits they're higher than they've ever been
AndrewMcAfee_2012X-0017072-0017626 i think that we ain't seen nothing yet when it comes to technology's impact on the labor force
AndrewMcAfee_2012X-0030133-0031392 which they will in six years they're not going to be two times better or four times better they'll be sixteen times better than they are right now so i start to think that a lot of knowledge work is going to be affected by this
AndrewMcAfee_2012X-0051563-0052066 the big stories the big developments in human history are the ones that will bend these curves a lot
AndrewMcAfee_2012X-0068592-0069995 i hear once in a while okay i'll grant you that but technology is still a tool for the rich world and what's not happening these digital tools are not improving the lives of people at the bottom of the pyramid and i want to say to that very clearly
AndrewMcAfee_2012X-0081273-0081931 and i am extremely confident that what we're going to do with our new digital tools is going to be so profound
AndrewMcAfee_2013-0016953-0017230 while at the same time prices go down
AndrewMcAfee_2013-0021546-0022454 performers and the innovators come together with their patrons and their financiers to talk about issues entertain enlighten provoke each other
AndrewMcAfee_2013-0025783-0027597 so this is a time of great flourishing and the more i look around the more convinced i become that this quote from the physicist freeman dyson is not hyperbole at all this is just a plain statement of the facts we are in the middle of an astonishing period technology is a gift of god after the gift of life it is perhaps the greatest of god's gifts it is the mother of civilizations of arts and of sciences freeman dyson which brings up another great question
AndrewMcAfee_2013-0042072-0043211 so this is not the set of challenges we really need to worry about to tell you the kinds of societal challenges that are going to come up in the new machine age i want to tell a story about two stereotypical american workers
AndrewMcAfee_2013-0056498-0056904 and the fact that it saves us from not one but three great evils
AndrewMcAfee_2013-0076057-0076739 but i actually don't think that's what we're going to do i think we're going to do something a lot better for one very straightforward reason
AndrewSolomon_2013P-0001318-0001682 in purely non religious terms
AndrewSolomon_2013P-0018746-0020217 i saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry i even went to the miss deaf america contest in nashville tennessee where people complained about that slurry southern signing
AndrewSolomon_2013P-0032439-0034126 you can argue that it's harder in the united states our current presidency notwithstanding to be a person of color and yet we have nobody who is trying to ensure that the next generation of children born to african americans and asians come out with creamy skin and yellow hair
AndrewSolomon_2013P-0042855-0044410 that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there quietly and his mother said she wasn't going to do it and she took her son home and even though she didn't have a lot of educational or financial advantages she found the best doctor in the country for dealing with diastrophic dwarfism
AndrewSolomon_2013P-0057150-0057467 it is sad yes dreadful
AndrewSolomon_2013P-0068939-0069645 and karen robards said to me i'm with tom for david i would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life
AndrewSolomon_2013P-0086315-0087796 it's a very extreme point of view but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have and they don't want to be cured or changed or eliminated they want to be whoever it is that they've come to be
AndrewSolomon_2013P-0101018-0102489 i would cling to the children i have and pray away that atrocious spectacle and ultimately i feel that in the same way that we test flame retardant pajamas in an inferno to ensure they won't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove
AndrewSolomon_2013P-0114255-0115245 i had a close friend from college who'd gone through a divorce and wanted to have children and so she and i have a daughter and mother and daughter live in texas
AndrewSolomon_2013P-0128509-0129002 we took him to the mri machine we took him to the cat scanner we took this day old child
AndyPuddicombe_2012S-0007062-0008018 be happy content emotionally stable as individuals and at the same time to be kind and thoughtful and considerate in our relationships with others
AndyPuddicombe_2012S-0022300-0023606 people often ask me what i learned from that time well obviously it changed things let's face it becoming a celibate monk is going to change a number of things but it was more than that
AndyPuddicombe_2012S-0030462-0031092 when there's a positive practical achievable scientifically proven technique
AndyPuddicombe_2012S-0041231-0042063 without all the usual involvement now what usually happens when we're learning to be mindful is that we get distracted
AngelaBelcher_2011X-0009602-0011325 and so going back to this abalone shell besides being nano structured one thing that's fascinating is when a male and a female abalone get together they pass on the genetic information that says this is how to build an exquisite material here's how to do it at room temperature and pressure using non toxic materials
AngelaBelcher_2011X-0040353-0040937 and so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical but they differ from each other based on their
AngelaDuckworth_2013S-0002287-0003624 i went to teach seventh graders math in the new york city public schools and like any teacher i made quizzes and tests i gave out homework assignments when the work came back i calculated grades
AngelaDuckworth_2013S-0020761-0022120 a few years ago i started studying grit in the chicago public schools i asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate
AngelaDuckworth_2013S-0033242-0034044 but we need more and that's where i'm going to end my remarks because that's where we are that's the work that stands before us
AngelaPatton_2012X-0014447-0014629 they acted sweet
AngelaPatton_2012X-0030454-0030776 the girls were dressed in their sunday best
AngelaPatton_2012X-0038663-0039214 this was going to be used as a touchstone so when they started to miss each other
AngelaPatton_2012X-0048352-0048625 and given the fathers the freedom
AnilAnanthaswamy_2010P-0016106-0016677 twenty three percent of the universe and something called dark energy which permeates the fabric of space time that makes up
AnilAnanthaswamy_2010P-0029727-0031457 you need something like tens of megatons of water almost a gigaton of water in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino and where in the world would you find such water well the russians have a tank in their own backyard this is lake baikal it is the largest lake in the world it's eight hundred km long
AnilAnanthaswamy_2010P-0046740-0047752 what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about and one piece of engineering that i want to leave you with as regards this telescope is the mirror
AnilAnanthaswamy_2010P-0059719-0060916 this is mcmurdo itself about a thousand people work here in summer and about two hundred in winter when it's completely dark for six months i was here to see the launch of this particular type of instrument
AnilAnanthaswamy_2010P-0080422-0081193 enormous disciplines that humanity has one is exploring the cosmos on the outside and the other one is exploring our interior being
AnnCooper_2007P-0023019-0024351 u s agriculture uses one point two billion pounds of pesticides every year that means every one of us and our children consumes what would equal a five pound bag those bags you have at home if i had one here and ripped it open and
AnnCooper_2007P-0061748-0063309 there's a lot of schools actually getting fresh food into schools now in berkeley we've gone totally fresh we have no high fructose corn syrup no trans fats no processed foods we're cooking from scratch every day we have twenty five percent of our
AnnCooper_2007P-0074238-0075003 have to start changing this we have to make kids understand that their food choices make a big difference
AnnCooper_2007P-0097622-0099188 i think if we're going to fix this one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the national school lunch program instead of the national school lunch program being under the usda i think it should be under cdc if we started to think about
AnnCooper_2007P-0110418-0110733 at that the richest country
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005-0001394-0002035 when i was a little girl if you say a word often enough it becomes you and having grown up in a segregated city baltimore maryland
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005-0013224-0013382 imitating robots
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005-0021796-0021940 and the baby looks you know the way
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005-0039088-0040104 like this as a good thing but there are certain other connotations to the word risk and the same thing about the word nature what is nature maxine greene who's a wonderful philosopher who's
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005-0049348-0049752 but that didn't change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family it was a nightmare
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005-0057835-0057960 i just sat there and
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005-0066529-0066674 we told a security guard
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005-0082186-0082497 in society and this is called swallowing the bitterness
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005-0092658-0093328 they were having a party they celebrated all of south central all the churches and they say well finally
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005-0104422-0104923 in the mainstream that's why i understand that's why i have a mixed feeling about the verdict
AnnaDeavereSmith_2005-0113956-0114770 and he's the lead in an op ed i did about the republican convention he's a republican i won't say anything about my party affiliation
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G-0006404-0006916 we have glass cockpit avionics that bring the information you need to fly directly to you in the cockpit
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G-0023196-0024215 fortunately necessity remains the mother of invention and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G-0056519-0056704 thank you for giving me the opportunity to share
AnnieLennox_2010G-0006134-0006555 standing in front of his former prison cell you can see the bars of the window there
AnnieLennox_2010G-0009263-0009688 this was a huge impact on my mind because i am a woman
AnnieLennox_2010G-0020015-0020480 it's a grassroots campaign with eighty percent membership being women
AnnieLennox_2010G-0029762-0029983 which is absolutely necessary
AnnieLennox_2010G-0039581-0039764 to tell you the little story
AnnieLennox_2010G-0050988-0051329 that every mother and every child in the world
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G-0012220-0013978 and one of the most fascinating insights i took from this work is that we're all learning about the world even before we enter it when we hold our babies for the first time we might imagine that they're clean slates unmarked by life
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G-0028113-0029901 so fetuses are even learning about the particular language that's spoken in the world that they'll be born into a study published last year found that from birth from the moment of birth babies cry in the accent of their mother's native language
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G-0043243-0044476 what this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat fetuses are also being taught about the particular culture that they'll be joining
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G-0059474-0060660 turning away all shipments of food the opening of the nazi's siege was followed by one of the harshest winters in decades so cold the water in the canals froze solid
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G-0072965-0073989 but that may not be all that's going on it seems that fetuses are taking cues from the intrauterine environment and tailoring their physiology accordingly
AnnieMurphyPaul_2011G-0087906-0088631 in the babies of those women who developed post traumatic stress syndrome or ptsd following their ordeal
AnthonyAtala_2009P-0004696-0005460 they were still dealing with a lot of the same challenges as many decades ago certainly many advances many lives saved
AnthonyAtala_2009P-0017427-0017877 actually we can regenerate your body
AnthonyAtala_2009P-0027658-0028410 on the left side we used that biomaterial in the middle and then six months later on the right hand side you see this reengineered urethra
AnthonyAtala_2009P-0039350-0040392 this muscle so that it knows what to do once we put it into the patient that's what you're seeing here you're seeing this muscle bio reactor actually exercising the muscle back and forth
AnthonyAtala_2009P-0052283-0053065 take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder we coat the inside with these bladder lining cells we coat the outside
AnthonyAtala_2009P-0059051-0060380 and the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy we take the scaffold we seed it with cells and you can now see here the valve leaflets opening and closing we exercise these prior to implantation same strategy
AnthonyAtala_2009P-0065615-0066682 this is actually an example several strategies to engineer solid organs this is actually one of the strategies we use a printer and instead of using ink we use you just saw and inkjet cartridge
AnthonyAtala_2009P-0077953-0079062 and we can then create functional livers and that's actually what you're seeing this is still experimental but we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure experimentally
AnthonyAtala_2009P-0090175-0090988 if we can not use stem cells from your body then we'd like to use donor stem cells and we prefer cells that will not reject
AnthonyAtala_2009P-0103635-0103867 actually took care
AnthonyAtala_2011-0010668-0011789 charles lindbergh that's the same charles lindbergh who actually spent the rest of his life working with alexis at the rockefeller institute in new york
AnthonyAtala_2011-0023872-0025480 these are actually cells that we obtained these are stem cells that we create from specific sources and we can drive them to become heart cells and they start beating in culture so they know what to do the cells genetically know what to do and they start beating together now
AnthonyAtala_2011-0032247-0032660 and then we exercise it so you see the leaflets opening and closing
AnthonyAtala_2011-0044419-0044980 actually a desktop inkjet printer but instead of using ink we're using cells
AnthonyAtala_2011-0059355-0060274 and we go layer by layer using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and three d reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys
AnthonyAtala_2011-0084231-0084551 these experiments sometimes work
AntonioDamasio_2011-0011521-0012539 in our brains but we certainly can begin to approach the question and we can begin to see the shape of a solution
AntonioDamasio_2011-0025579-0026527 we have selves we have a me that is automatically present in our minds right now we own our minds
AntonioDamasio_2011-0045725-0047412 so this is how close your mental experience and the activity of the neurons in the retina which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball or for that matter a sheet of visual cortex so from the retina you go onto visual cortex and
AntonioDamasio_2011-0060583-0062391 from day to day well it so happens that we have a singular body we have one body not two not three and so that is a beginning there is just one reference point which is the body but then of course the body has many parts and things grow at different rates and they have different sizes and different people
AntonioDamasio_2011-0077506-0078061 so in that green component of the brain stem if you damage it and often it happens
AntonioDamasio_2011-0090658-0091990 cortex and brain stem you cannot have a conscious mind if you don't have the interaction between the brain stem and the body another thing that is interesting is that the brain stem that we have is shared with a variety of other species
AntonioDamasio_2011-0098121-0100077 also an autobiographical self to a certain degree and everybody's dogs at home have an autobiographical self to a certain degree but the novelty is here the autobiographical self is built on the basis of past memories and memories of the plans that we have made it's the lived past and the anticipated future
AntonioDamasio_2011-0107949-0108458 of humankind are diseases such as depression alzheimer's disease
AntonyGormley_2012G-0014574-0015863 in a space the subjective collective space of the darkness of the body i think of this as the place of imagination
AntonyGormley_2012G-0034509-0035817 world the elemental world that we all live in is that space that we all visited together the darkness of the body
AntonyGormley_2012G-0049202-0050889 can we do it another way using the language of particles around a nucleus and talk about the body as an energy center no longer about statues no longer having to take that duty of standing the standing of a human body or the standing of a statue release it
AntonyGormley_2012G-0066047-0067610 a field that involves living and the surrogate bodies in a kind of relation a relation with each other and a relation with that limit the edge the horizon
AntonyGormley_2012G-0084610-0085315 you disappear both to yourselves and to others
AnupamMishra_2009I-0009437-0010719 a number of techniques to harvest rain this is a new work it's a new program but for the desert society this is no program this is their life and they
AnupamMishra_2009I-0023710-0024412 six million gallons of rainwater in one season the age is four hundred years
AnupamMishra_2009I-0029173-0029691 these are not empty canisters water level is right up to this it can
AnupamMishra_2009I-0034810-0035836 these big canals like anything of course there are some areas where water is reaching i'm not saying that it is not reaching at all but the tail end the
AnupamMishra_2009I-0047108-0047861 in this slide but it is invisible somewhere a stream or a rivulet is
AnupamMishra_2009I-0058412-0058766 small water body called the it is difficult to
AnupamMishra_2009I-0073254-0074048 your own thing not personal property my property every time so these
AnupamMishra_2009I-0086490-0087344 this tire comes from the airplane so look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater
AnupamMishra_2009I-0100539-0101801 and one stores so it depends on the terrain but kund which uses the gypsum belt for that you have to go back to your calendar three million years
AparnaRao_2011G-0038933-0039905 and the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear which is very comforting and intimate
ApolloRobbins_2013G-0014004-0014980 so frank is sitting at a desk he's got all sorts of cool information in front of him high tech equipment he's got cameras he's got a little phone that he can pick up listen to the ears
ApolloRobbins_2013G-0021137-0021875 he accesses the file he has to rewind the tape and what's interesting is he can't rewind the tape at the same time that he's trying to process new data
AriannaHuffington_2010W-0001694-0001946 idea is a very very small idea
AriannaHuffington_2010W-0013054-0013549 there is now a kind of sleep deprivation one upmanship especially here
ArielGarten_2011X-0004565-0004733 as a statement about the problems
ArielGarten_2011X-0055382-0055778 i like to call this intra
ArielGarten_2011X-0087195-0087415 to me
ArisVenetikidis_2012X-0006044-0006309 and of course it meant that i was a foreigner in both countries
ArisVenetikidis_2012X-0016965-0018740 this of course makes for some funny moments when you're in some old city layout that follows some sort of circular city logic yeah maybe you've had that experience as well right let's say you're on some spot on a side street that projects from a main cathedral square
ArisVenetikidis_2012X-0030381-0030992 it's got straight lines it's got ninety degree corners you might add little symbols along the way
ArisVenetikidis_2012X-0042592-0043435 now we've reached the subject of public transport and public transport here in dublin is a somewhat touchy subject
ArisVenetikidis_2012X-0053584-0054728 they were having a lot of omission of information but unfortunately the wrong information say in the city center there were never actually any lines that showed the routes
ArisVenetikidis_2012X-0068939-0069820 my academic research loads of questionnaires case studies and looking at a lot of maps
ArisVenetikidis_2012X-0082382-0084250 this map only shows the rapid transport connections no local bus very much in the metro map style that was so successful in london and that since has been exported to so many other major cities and therefore is the language that we should use for public transport maps
ArisVenetikidis_2012X-0093637-0094234 the language of way finding in our brain so straightened lines cleaned up corners
ArthurBenjamin_2005-0012585-0014022 and on most calculators that will give you the square on some of these ancient rpn calculators you've got an x squared button on it will allow you to do the calculation even faster what i'm going to try and do now is to square in my head four two digit numbers
ArthurBenjamin_2005-0036798-0037604 so you should have as an answer either a six digit or probably a seven digit number how many digits do you have six or seven seven and yours
ArthurBenjamin_2005-0059666-0060326 that book in front of you do me a favor turn to a year outside of the nineteen hundreds either into the eighteen hundreds or way into the
ArthurBenjamin_2005-0067607-0068615 now i have to apologize to our magician friend lennart green i know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets but i'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week
ArthurBenjamin_2005-0076111-0076354 while i do these calculation you might
ArthurBenjamin_2009-0003660-0004428 and algebra and everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject and at top of that pyramid
ArthurBenjamin_2009-0015465-0016919 in summary instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus i think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means and i mean it thank you very much
ArthurGanson_2004-0009926-0010282 so i started to explore motion by making little
ArthurGanson_2004-0017207-0017769 i was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon
ArthurGanson_2004-0024394-0025546 connection i have with engineering is the same as any other engineer in that i love to solve problems i love to figure things out but the end result of what i'm doing is
ArthurGanson_2004-0035213-0036003 playing with this wishbone after dinner you know they say never play with your food but i always play with things so i had this wishbone and i thought
ArthurGanson_2004-0045445-0046465 then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center and they would coalesce for just a moment
ArthurGanson_2004-0056148-0056679 and it's really just sort of for me it was just really about the lusciousness of oil
ArthurGanson_2004-0066166-0066564 my life completely changed when i found a spot welder
ArthurGanson_2004-0073068-0073295 so that's what it does
ArthurGanson_2004-0082355-0083314 and i think there's a point between simplicity and ambiguity which can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G-0005699-0006689 it's then distributed and distribution is a massive issue it's then sold and bought and it's then delivered to me i basically take it prepare it and
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G-0022667-0023832 three compost bins go through about seventy kilos of raw vegetable waste a week really good makes fantastic compost a couple of wormeries in there too and actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery i had a lot of worms in it
ArthurPottsDawson_2010G-0044227-0045320 that's zero food waste and no one's doing that just yet in fact sainbury's if you're watching try it on i'm going to get there before you so nature
ArunachalamMuruganantham_2012S-0008757-0008983 i don't know why i did not ask for a condom
ArunachalamMuruganantham_2012S-0045667-0046894 you just think competing giants even from harvard oxford is difficult i make a rural woman to compete with multinationals i'm sustaining on seventh year already six
ArvindGupta_2010P-0015549-0017431 with four you make a square you make a pentagon you make a hexagon you make all these kind of polygons and they have some wonderful properties if you look at the hexagon for instance it's like an amoeba which is constantly changing its own profile you can just pull this out this becomes a rectangle you give it a push this becomes a parallelogram but this is very shaky
AsherHasan_2009I-0002593-0003267 and pakistan in this particular vein is very similar because it has provoked and does provoke
AsherHasan_2009I-0019768-0020728 by providing them with affordable access to catastrophic health care indeed it is the emerging world's first hmo for the urban working poor
AshrafGhani_2005G-0015646-0016902 that is cut right from under the poorest second is technical assistance and technical assistance might shock you but it's the worst form of today of the ugly face
AshrafGhani_2005G-0030939-0031898 my colleagues at johns hopkins were among the best second instead of debating endlessly about what is
AshrafGhani_2005G-0046445-0047040 the first challenge is to rethink fundamentally the
AshrafGhani_2005G-0064422-0065817 today the world of globalization is on speed time has been compressed and space does not exist for most people but in my world you know when i went back to afghanistan after twenty three years
AshrafGhani_2005G-0079932-0080602 in terms of their discourse in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world i think that i
AshrafGhani_2005G-0095580-0096383 and we need to understand it's the value chain look and the ordinary afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit
AshrafGhani_2005G-0106895-0107908 you would think that the us government would not think that american firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries provide advice but they do
AtulGawande_2012-0010142-0010369 and the answer is yes
AtulGawande_2012-0018442-0018645 and there were a few
AtulGawande_2012-0027516-0028651 you set the fracture you drew the blood you spun the blood looked at it under the microscope you plated the culture you injected the antiserum this was
AtulGawande_2012-0035995-0036325 in our own country let alone around the world
AtulGawande_2012-0050536-0050779 from start to finish
AtulGawande_2012-0056746-0057888 as we've looked at the data about the results that have come as the complexity has increased we found that the most expensive care
AtulGawande_2012-0060883-0061141 well then we really would be talking about rationing
AtulGawande_2012-0068427-0068758 a very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere
AtulGawande_2012-0077704-0078323 skill one find where your failures are skill two is devise solutions
AtulGawande_2012-0091312-0091556 or missed if they're not checked
AtulGawande_2012-0101745-0102232 let alone making checklists to go onto childbirth and other areas
AubreydeGrey_2005G-0003656-0004604 you know how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong namely by actually doing something about it i'm going to do that in two steps the first one i'm going to talk about is
AubreydeGrey_2005G-0017371-0018300 and i mean ok i'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless there are some good points to be made here things that we ought to be thinking about forward planning so that
AubreydeGrey_2005G-0031683-0032472 do anything that we might want to do to do that like for example making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all but of course
AubreydeGrey_2005G-0048360-0049301 what would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today or equivalently of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive would actually live
AubreydeGrey_2005G-0056225-0057216 you can look at medical care i mean hygiene vaccines antibiotics you know the same sort of time frame so i think that actually step two that i called a step a moment ago isn't a step
AubreydeGrey_2005G-0064341-0065214 across so these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live in terms of remaining life expectancy as measured by their health
AubreydeGrey_2005G-0082616-0083439 the public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that the public tend to underestimate how difficult scientific things are so they'll probably think it's five years away they'll be wrong but that actually won't matter too much
AubreydeGrey_2005G-0097142-0098262 the list on the right is also incomplete it's a list of types of pathology that are age related and it's just an incomplete list but i would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete this is the list of
AubreydeGrey_2005G-0110556-0111397 you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously so you know you've got to actually do your homework in order to understand whether this is true
AubreydeGrey_2005G-0126894-0127582 i read somewhere that in the last twenty years the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by ten years
AuretvanHeerden_2010G-0003990-0004354 that factory over a dozen people have committed suicide already this year
AuretvanHeerden_2010G-0019668-0020113 serious a deficit of rights we have this is an independent republic
AuretvanHeerden_2010G-0029514-0029752 which mimicked heparin in
AuretvanHeerden_2010G-0036011-0036655 and we don't have a governance system we don't have a regulatory system able to ensure that that production
AuretvanHeerden_2010G-0040092-0041197 at a national level have even less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level and you can just look at the headlines take copenhagen last year
AuretvanHeerden_2010G-0047310-0047558 fortunately we have some examples
AuretvanHeerden_2010G-0060746-0060926 be amazing if they were able to
AuretvanHeerden_2010G-0068434-0068754 safe space you need a place where people can come together
AuretvanHeerden_2010G-0078128-0078261 and then we publish the results
AuretvanHeerden_2010G-0089993-0090477 what they lack is that safe space to come together agree and move to action
AuretvanHeerden_2010G-0097307-0097622 poor people people whose human rights have been violated
AviRubin_2011X-0005132-0005650 but that's not the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard anyone say about my work
AviRubin_2011X-0023858-0024962 and they were able to change therapies including disabling the device and this is with a real commercial off the shelf device simply by performing reverse engineering and sending wireless signals to it
AviRubin_2011X-0039826-0040338 carried out their attack in real life they bought two cars and i guess they have better budgets than i do
AviRubin_2011X-0053802-0055602 surveillance was really interesting the authors of the study have a video where they show themselves taking over a car and then turning on the microphone in the car and listening in on the car while tracking it via gps on a map and so that's something that the drivers of the car would never know was happening
AviRubin_2011X-0071515-0072199 so they bought a scanner these are perfectly legal and they run at the frequency of the p twenty five
AviRubin_2011X-0085659-0087446 to have a training phase and so they got most likely grad students to type in a whole lot of things and to learn to have the system use the machine learning tools that were available to learn what it is that the people were typing and to match that up with the measurements in the accelerometer
AyahBdeir_2012U-0002627-0004071 very quickly concrete blocks became the most used construction unit in the world they enabled us to to build things that were larger than us buildings bridges one brick at a time essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time
AyahBdeir_2012U-0015891-0016172 you put a blue to a green you can make light
BLACK_2013-0015999-0016643 i started to learn classic ballet jazz dance acrobatics and other things to make my performance better
BabaShiv_2012X-0009982-0011457 and we were certainly in the driver's seat making all these decisions and let me tell you if some of you had been there it was a most agonizing and harrowing experience which got me thinking i said is there any validity to this whole adage
BabaShiv_2012X-0024097-0025268 so if you think about it this is an extreme case scenario because in the real world whenever you are taking passenger's seat very often the driver is going to be someone you trust an expert etc so this is an extreme case scenario
BahiaShehab_2012G-0007791-0009377 in september of two thousand and ten now in january two thousand and eleven the revolution started and life stopped for eighteen days and on the twelfth of february we naively celebrated on the streets of cairo
BandiMbubi_2012X-0007020-0007340 how naturally your finger slides towards the buttons
BandiMbubi_2012X-0029597-0030711 and in the wake of the result the diaspora has joined with the carter center the catholic church
BandiMbubi_2012X-0047634-0048176 if you were lucky
BarbaraBlock_2010Z-0013776-0014790 now in the atlantic the story is pretty simple bluefin have two populations one large one small the north american population is fished at about two thousand ton
BarbaraBlock_2010Z-0027919-0028720 we're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create
BarbaraBlock_2010Z-0042064-0042810 our own chuck farwell alex norton who can take a big tuna and in one motion put it into an envelope of water
BarbaraBlock_2010Z-0059405-0060683 both the electronic tags i'm talking about are expensive these tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in north america they are some of our finest instruments our new technology in the ocean today
BarbaraBlock_2010Z-0078085-0079238 now in a second project called tagging of pacific pelagics we took on the planet as a team those of us in the census of marine life and funded primarily through sloan foundation and others
BarbaraBlock_2010Z-0095248-0095945 stick out the tuna and then let them go they get returned and when they get returned here on a nasa
BarbaraBlock_2010Z-0111809-0112583 tagged turtles brought in four million hits and now with google's oceans we can actually put a white shark in that ocean
BarrySchuler_2008P-0006149-0007063 and that moved us to the next level and you know we in the last thirty years in particular have seen this acceleration in knowledge and
BarrySchuler_2008P-0021099-0021716 since the beginning of us of us as creatures there is a historical archive
BarrySchuler_2008P-0034755-0035489 a lot of ways to describe mechanisms so let's talk about what that means so if you look at a human genome
BarrySchuler_2008P-0045439-0046347 that don't appear to function every day but represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species going back
BarrySchuler_2008P-0054736-0055416 all the time the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human
BarrySchuler_2008P-0060554-0061497 but what scientists are doing now is they're understanding what these do and what they mean because what nature is doing is double clicking all the time
BarrySchuler_2008P-0075899-0076132 completely synthesize that genome
BarrySchuler_2008P-0086403-0087019 knowing that we can read it knowing that we can write it change it maybe write its genome from scratch
BarrySchuler_2008P-0096611-0097916 by discovering all new microbes in the first twenty feet of water we now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate and regulating co two and oxygen than plants do which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere
BarrySchuler_2008P-0112759-0113891 i consider myself a very spiritual person and without you know the organized religion part and i will tell you i don't believe there's anything unnatural i don't believe that
BarrySchuler_2008P-0125376-0125570 if we could would we
BarrySchwartz_2009-0009815-0010666 even though this is a very long list there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings not one
BarrySchwartz_2009-0022343-0023389 a wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties
BarrySchwartz_2009-0034801-0035857 now i hope that we all know this there's a sense in which it's obvious and yet let me tell you a little story it's a story about lemonade
BarrySchwartz_2009-0047868-0048797 the second tool we reach for is incentives better ones more of them what else after all is there
BarrySchwartz_2009-0060058-0060816 we know why these scripts are there we don't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own
BarrySchwartz_2009-0074402-0075045 when incentives don't work when ceos ignore the long term health of their companies in pursuit of short term gains
BarrySchwartz_2009-0092578-0093298 go maybe on paper our company is worth less to wall street but i can tell you it's worth more we're doing fine
BarrySchwartz_2009-0106193-0107340 because the truth is that any work that you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work and any moral work depends upon practical wisdom
BarrySchwartz_2009-0120208-0120871 to how we do it and perhaps most importantly to the structure of the organizations in which we work
BarrySchwartz_2010S-0011268-0011844 if things aren't going right the first response is let's make more rules
BarrySchwartz_2010S-0018885-0019779 the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing even out of pure selfishness so we offer teachers bonuses
BarrySchwartz_2010S-0024776-0025648 more interested in serving the long term interests even of their own companies rather than securing short term profits
BarrySchwartz_2010S-0034565-0034729 we need character
BarrySchwartz_2010S-0045740-0046784 you started but then you dance around the notes on the page coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players
BarrySchwartz_2010S-0056888-0057030 it was a toy gun he got
BarrySchwartz_2010S-0074888-0076235 third don't waste your time on kids who moved into the district too late for their scores to be counted focus all of your time and attention on the kids who are on the bubble
BarrySchwartz_2010S-0087424-0088213 if you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures which is the current system they would do more if instead you reward doctors for doing
BarrySchwartz_2010S-0100621-0101140 he was married he had a third kid on the way he suffered from ptsd in addition to the bad
BarrySchwartz_2010S-0109781-0111088 to fashion responses to their crimes that helped them to rehabilitate themselves and didn't forget about them once the judgment was made stayed with them followed up on them made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan
BarrySchwartz_2010S-0120642-0121282 that serves only itself banking wasn't always this way and it doesn't have to be this way
BarrySchwartz_2010S-0134991-0136090 rules and incentives don't tell you how to be a good friend how to be a good parent how to be a good spouse or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher
BartKnols_2012X-0006809-0006961 the smell of her body
BartKnols_2012X-0017365-0017521 in a large cage
BartKnols_2012X-0026333-0026652 as it is now used in the fight against malaria
BartKnols_2012X-0038028-0038265 which means that now we can use dogs
BartKnols_2012X-0048312-0048587 here in this box i have a cage
BartWeetjens_2010X-0002583-0003315 training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis
BartWeetjens_2010X-0009140-0009879 in a linear extracting and manufacturing mode i quit my job to focus on the real world problem
BartWeetjens_2010X-0016252-0017215 very sustainable in this environment here the animal gets its food reward and that's how it works very very simple
BartWeetjens_2010X-0030850-0032014 which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid moreover this small team together with of course you need the heavy vehicles and the manual deminers to follow up
BartWeetjens_2010X-0042840-0043434 it makes sense you can actually cure t b even in hiv positives
BartWeetjens_2010X-0055437-0055922 a cage like this operating throughout the day can process one thousand six hundred and eighty samples
BartWeetjens_2010X-0069460-0070567 doing that with a local resource plenty available so something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about
BartonSeaver_2010Z-0012840-0013738 do i do this three times a week i might still be in the green list but i'm not doing myself or you or the oceans any favors
BartonSeaver_2010Z-0038902-0039862 restorative options this is what we need to favor this is what the green list says but this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment
BartonSeaver_2010Z-0054985-0055892 we need to savor vegetables we need to savor smaller portions of seafood and we need to save dinner thank you
BastianSchaefer_2013G-0015141-0016539 so we combined these needs with technology's themes so for instance we are asking ourselves how can we create more light how can we bring more natural light into the airplane so this airplane has no windows anymore for example
Beardyman_2013-0009395-0009873 it
Beardyman_2013-0024296-0024535 thank you beautiful assistant
Beardyman_2013-0064812-0065587 loosely defined that is what's possible with the human voice thank you very much
BeatriceCoron_2011-0021701-0023014 so artist books have a lot of definitions they come in a lot of different shapes but to me they are fascinating objects to visually narrate a story
BeatriceCoron_2011-0039518-0039960 and we would leave a very low footprint on the planet
BeatriceCoron_2011-0053011-0053201 a web of time
BeatriceCoron_2011-0072178-0072361 why do i call it a book
BeatriceCoron_2011-0078366-0079793 that's in stainless steel instead of paper i called it working in the same direction but i added weathervanes on both sides to show that they cover all directions
BeatriceCoron_2011-0091036-0091889 so in aurora colorado it's a bench but you have a bonus with this bench because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts
BeatriceCoron_2011-0107308-0107727 and how we can reconnect with the essential and with the magic
BeauLotto_2009G-0011604-0012218 we see what we do but who we are as individuals and who we are as a society
BeauLotto_2009G-0024851-0025491 so how on earth do we even see so if you remember anything in this next eighteen minutes
BeauLotto_2009G-0038977-0039177 right why because
BeauLotto_2009G-0050701-0052162 and see what happens to your perception the four blue tiles on the left are gray the seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray they are the same okay don't believe me let's watch it again
BeauLotto_2009G-0066285-0066429 now remember
BeauLotto_2009G-0076720-0076862 and find a plate on the
BeauLotto_2009G-0093826-0094845 purplish light now some of you will notice that the consequence is that the light coming through those middle nine on the right
BeauLotto_2012G-0016960-0018657 the question why is one of the most dangerous things you can do because it takes you into uncertainty and yet the irony is the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space so how can we ever do anything new well fortunately
BeauLotto_2012G-0033334-0034345 now here i want to share the stage with someone quite special right she was one of the young people who was involved in this study and she's now one of the youngest published scientists in the world
BeauLotto_2012G-0070477-0071938 it was the editors choice in science which is a top science magazine it's forever freely accessible by biology letters it's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal last year it was the second most downloaded paper by biology letters
BecciManson_2012G-0008970-0009495 and traveled over two miles inland as you can imagine the town had been devastated
BecciManson_2012G-0029448-0029729 the time it took however to get it
BecciManson_2012G-0049731-0050239 and the first thing you'd go back to look for that's all this project was about
BeckyBlanton_2009G-0003118-0003293 i became one of the working homeless
BeckyBlanton_2009G-0008477-0008995 three i failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude not a lifestyle
BeckyBlanton_2009G-0014506-0014663 food rotted in the heat
BeckyBlanton_2009G-0022313-0022552 my i q hadn't dropped my talent
BeckyBlanton_2009G-0031523-0031810 former moderator of meet the press was talking about my writing
BeebanKidron_2012S-0002474-0004440 from mother to daughter preacher to congregant teacher to pupil storyteller to audience whether in cave paintings or the latest uses of the internet human beings have always told their histories and truths through parable and fable we are inveterate storytellers

BeebanKidron_2012S-0032458-0033089 in choosing hotel rwanda they explored genocide of the most brutal kind
BeebanKidron_2012S-0053007-0053241 i was past forty when my father died
BeebanKidron_2012S-0062408-0064265 we honor reading why not honor watching with the same passion consider citizen kane as valuable as jane austen agree that boyz n the hood like tennyson offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding that work together each a piece of memorable art
BenCameron_2010X-0001569-0002628 i am a cultural omnivore one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an ipod an ipod that contains wagner and mozart pop diva christina aquilera
BenCameron_2010X-0011921-0012960 five yeas ago gen x'ers spent twenty point seven hours online and tv the majority on tv gen y'ers spent even more twenty three point eight hours the majority online
BenCameron_2010X-0024937-0025535 many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of tower records and ask ourselves are we next
BenCameron_2010X-0037795-0038530 warner bros rko did that for you now go to youtube facebook you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own

BenDunlap_2007-0005142-0005998 at every critical juncture of my life there has been a hungarian friend or mentor there beside me i even have dreams that take place in landscapes
BenDunlap_2007-0018251-0019447 i knew nothing about wofford and even less about methodism but i was reassured on the first day that i taught at wofford college to find among the auditors in my classroom a ninety year old hungarian
BenDunlap_2007-0026567-0027197 he had left instructions to have done he was summoned in the middle of the night by the night watchman at one of his plants
BenDunlap_2007-0035230-0035536 it was a brutal beating and midway through
BenDunlap_2007-0049170-0050193 you bring the best workers you can find and if they are good enough i will hire them as it happens the black minister did his job better than the white mayor but that's neither here or there misterteszler hired sixteen
BenDunlap_2007-0060352-0060555 his eighties mister teszler
BenDunlap_2007-0070130-0071435 and on the first occasion that i visited his house he gave me honor of deciding what piece of music we would listen to and i delighted him by rejecting cavalerria rusticana in favor of bela bartok's bluebeard's castle
BenDunlap_2007-0081818-0082105 human beings are fundamentally good
BenDunlap_2007-0092712-0092909 this is absolutely dazzling
BenDunlap_2007-0105843-0107173 and it lay precisely in that insatiable curiosity that irrepressible desire to know no matter what the subject no matter what the cost even at a time when the keepers of the doomsday clock are willing to bet even
BenGoldacre_2011G-0007750-0009421 unpicking dodgy claims unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims isn't a kind of nasty carping activity it's socially useful but it's also an extremely valuable explanatory tool because real science is all about critically appraising the evidence for somebody else's
BenGoldacre_2011G-0020588-0022487 so you go and find this paper and what you find is it is a real piece of science it is a description of the changes in one enzyme when you drip a chemical extracted from some red grape skin onto some cancer cells in a dish on a bench in a laboratory somewhere and that's a really useful thing to describe in a scientific paper
BenGoldacre_2011G-0035832-0036220 and then a year later they were going to measure their school exam performance and compare
BenGoldacre_2011G-0047461-0049178 trials against placebo everybody thinks they know that a trial should be a comparison of your new drug against placebo but actually in a lot of situations that's wrong because often we already have a very good treatment that is currently available so we don't want to know that your alternative new treatment is better than nothing we want to know that it's better than the best currently available treatment that we have
BenGoldacre_2011G-0068023-0069664 this is a drug called reboxetine this is a drug that i myself have prescribed to patients and i'm a very nerdy doctor i hope i try to go out of my way to try and read and understand all the literature i read the trials on this they were all positive they were all well conducted i found no flaw unfortunately it turned out
BenGoldacre_2011G-0082869-0083116 i think that sunlight
BenGoldacre_2012P-0011690-0012594 but it doesn't just happen in the dry academic field of psychology it also happens in for example cancer research
BenGoldacre_2012P-0026908-0027410 unnecessarily in america from the prescription of anti arrhythmic drugs
BenGoldacre_2012P-0040420-0040889 i felt misled
BenGoldacre_2012P-0052999-0053425 this is a cancer at the core of evidence based medicine
BenGoldacre_2012P-0060301-0062205 this is a drug called tamiflu tamiflu is a drug which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on stockpiling and we've stockpiled tamiflu in panic in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza complications is a medical euphemism for pneumonia and death
BenGoldacre_2012P-0068356-0068791 but we've had to suffer fake fixes we've had people pretend
BenKacyra_2011G-0005445-0005735 about that civilization and their work
BenKacyra_2011G-0019553-0020171 world sites we called the project cyark which stands for cyber archive
BenKacyra_2011G-0033871-0035310 i got involved in the heritage field the more it became clear to me that we are losing the sites and the stories faster than we can physically preserve them
BenKacyra_2011G-0050871-0051104 and at the same time it gives them
BenKacyra_2011G-0063984-0064225 on the screen
BenKatchor_2002-0007148-0008336 where to reach when we enter a dark room we automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward but the sound we are greeted with as the room is bathed
BenKatchor_2002-0018049-0019496 adults find it comforting but wouldn't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship or the recorded crowing of a rooster
BenKatchor_2002-0031394-0032695 the small commercial building from an earlier century whose upper floors have been sealed and whose groundfloor space now functions as a taxpayer
BenKatchor_2002-0044355-0045520 the ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap the illusion of speech follows incidentally
BenKatchor_2002-0056921-0057860 the profound convolutions on the surface of a dried cherry the foreboding sheen of an extra large date
BenSaunders_2005-0015924-0016764 a wire dangling down either side that was our hf radio antenna we had less than two hours two way communication with the outside world in two months
BenSaunders_2005-0046332-0047013 i didn't have a hope in hell i had to pull one leave it and go back and get the other one literally scrambling through what's called pressure ice the ice had been
BenSaunders_2005-0072982-0073062 the the whole world
BenSaunders_2005-0090870-0091627 for me this is about exploring human limits about exploring the limits of physiology of psychology and of technology they're the things that excite me
BenSaunders_2012S-0012565-0013894 there is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever oh we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation
BenSaunders_2012S-0021598-0022214 a lot of experts were saying it was impossible and my mum certainly wasn't very keen on the idea
BenSaunders_2012S-0032902-0033785 for nearly three months was unique to me no one else will ever could ever possibly see the views the vistas that i saw for ten weeks
BenSaunders_2012S-0050530-0052154 but scott's journey remains unfinished no one has ever walked from the very coast of antarctica to the south pole and back again it is arguably the most audacious endeavor of that edwardian golden age of exploration and it seemed to me high time given everything we have figured out
BenjaminBarber_2013G-0006559-0007973 autonomous sovereign nation states with jurisdictions and territories separate from one another each claiming to be able to solve the problem of its own people
BenjaminBarber_2013G-0023241-0025061 we watch the men and women we choose rule rule more or less without us not so in those homes known as our towns and cities where we live moreover today more than half of the world's population
BenjaminBarber_2013G-0038765-0039653 how can we create a world in which mayors and the citizens they represent play a more prominent role well
BenjaminBarber_2013G-0057685-0058801 so mayors are pragmatists and problem solvers they get things done but the second thing about mayors is they are also what i like to call homeboys
BenjaminBarber_2013G-0074723-0075296 organizations like the c forty like iclei which i mentioned have been working together
BenjaminBarber_2013G-0089141-0090104 the bottom line is we still live politically in a world of borders a world of boundaries a world of walls a world where states refuse
BenjaminBarber_2013G-0105007-0106522 to reach out and embrace a new global democracy to take back our democracy and the only question is are you thank you so much my fellow
BenjaminWallace_2008P-0021140-0022052 for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them so that's why you're going to see this recurring character which i guess you know communicates to you that i did not think that one was really worth the
BenjaminWallace_2008P-0035461-0035961 and then hand dipped in natural indigo twenty four times but no compliments
BenjaminWallace_2008P-0048212-0049331 and then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats leavings then go through the
BenjaminWallace_2008P-0062103-0062913 this is the fastest street legal car in the world and the most expensive production car i got to drive this with a chaperone from the company
BenjaminWallace_2008P-0081228-0081954 any one of the wines served at this tasting if i'd been served it at a dinner party it would have been you know the wine experience of my lifetime and incredibly
BenjaminZander_2008-0012941-0013205 for another and takes lessons now he's ten
BenjaminZander_2008-0022646-0023625 and i was working with this young pianist and i said the trouble with you is you're a two buttock player you should be a one buttock player and i moved his body like that while he was playing and suddenly the music took off
BenjaminZander_2008-0032948-0033836 and the telephone the telephone if your mother calls on the miserable telephone she calls and says hello you not only know who it is you know what mood she's in
BenjaminZander_2008-0038758-0039504 it's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he's leading
BenjaminZander_2008-0056697-0057266 nobody is tone deaf right nobody is you know every village in bangladesh and every
BenjaminZander_2008-0070298-0071129 to e it's the wrong chord it's the wrong chord it's the wrong chord and finally goes to e and it's home and what you're going to see is one buttock playing
BenjaminZander_2008-0094978-0096014 by a piece by chopin now that is something now am i sure that every single person followed that understood it was moved by it of course i can't be sure but i tell you what happened to me i was in ireland
BenjaminZander_2008-0108819-0109632 you could light up a village with this guy's eyes right so if the eyes are shining you know you're doing it if the eyes are not shining you
BenoitMandelbrot_2010-0002274-0003234 well the topic i'm going to discuss is one which is in a certain sense very peculiar because it's very old roughness is part of human life
BenoitMandelbrot_2010-0015332-0016088 that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property that each part is like the whole but smaller
BenoitMandelbrot_2010-0027324-0028039 you must do it differently what good is that to know these things well surprisingly enough it's good in many ways
BenoitMandelbrot_2010-0043814-0044673 not an explanation of clouds the seer of clouds had to take account of it i don't know how much
BenoitMandelbrot_2010-0058121-0058833 painter hokusai knew it very well the things on the ground are algae he did not know the mathematics it didn't yet exist
BenoitMandelbrot_2010-0069963-0070631 to be at the same time a mechanical engineer a geographer and a mathematician and so on
BenoitMandelbrot_2010-0081753-0082372 in a way it's the story of my life my adolescence was spent during the german occupation of france and
BenoitMandelbrot_2010-0097489-0098077 a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing so where did this come from obviously from
BernieKrause_2013G-0011539-0012388 there was a time when i considered wild soundscapes to be a worthless artifact they were just there but they had no significance
BernieKrause_2013G-0034552-0036535 well a year later i returned and using the same protocols and recording under the same conditions i recorded a number of examples of the same dawn choruses and now this is what we've got this is after selective logging you can see that the stream is still represented in the bottom third of the page but notice what's missing
BernieKrause_2013G-0049129-0050541 at the end of its breeding cycle the great basin spadefoot toad digs itself down about a meter under the hard panned desert soil of the american west where it can stay for many seasons until conditions are just right for it to emerge again
BernieKrause_2013G-0058055-0058969 and so loud that the anthrophony the human noise even though it's six and a half kilometers from the frog pond you just heard a second ago
BernieKrause_2013G-0066666-0068288 a colleague of mine was recording in the american midwest around this pond that had been formed maybe sixteen thousand years ago at the end of the last ice age it was also formed in part by a beaver dam at one end that held that whole ecosystem together in a very delicate
BernieKrause_2013G-0084557-0084980 for all things especially our own humanity and
BertrandPiccard_2009G-0009021-0009825 we go very well in unforeseen directions we want to go in a direction but the winds push us in another direction like in life
BertrandPiccard_2009G-0020608-0021320 life is going to be made out of all the possible lines that go in all the possible directions in three
BertrandPiccard_2009G-0038749-0039538 and this is why you need weathermen this is why you need people with long term vision and this is precisely what fails
BertrandPiccard_2009G-0050706-0051334 i had no idea how it was possible i just thought it's a dream and i want to do it
BertrandPiccard_2009G-0063416-0064411 if we want to show the potential we have to fly day and night that means to load the batteries during the flight in order to spend the night on the batteries
BertrandPiccard_2009G-0076705-0077388 real airplane that we could finally present and what's the goal now the goal is to take
BertrandPiccard_2009G-0083147-0084157 it's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation without a major problem so you see that this airplane is more a symbol i don't think it will transport two hundred people in the next
BertrandPiccard_2009G-0088922-0089793 pleases me very much is that in the beginning i thought that we would have to fly around the world with no fuel in order to have our message been understood
BertrandPiccard_2009G-0099925-0100791 if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice to go through the obstacle to go through the problem in order to see what there is on the other side
BethNoveck_2012G-0012582-0013360 so when we wanted to create our open government policy what did we do we wanted naturally to ask public sector employees how we should open up government
BethNoveck_2012G-0026685-0027614 of big data of social networks and we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions that are actually quite recent
BethNoveck_2012G-0043098-0043798 powerful practical palpable model for handing power from government to citizens
BethNoveck_2012G-0059821-0061351 the finalists are announced in the competition can you imagine in the bureaucratic world of yesteryear getting anything done in a four month period of time you can barely fill out the forms in that amount of time let alone generate real palpable innovations that improve people's lives
BethNoveck_2012G-0077111-0079067 simply throwing data over the transom doesn't change how government works it doesn't get anybody to do anything with that data to change lives to solve problems and it doesn't change government what it does is it creates an adversarial relationship between civil society and government over the control and ownership of information
BethNoveck_2012G-0090976-0091327 there are many things that we can do to get us there
BethNoveck_2012G-0097042-0097520 innovation towards this open government movement towards this open government revolution
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W-0003329-0003376 one would
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W-0016349-0017119 well we needn't have worried she came charging out of the thicket straight towards us sat next to us shivering
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W-0029439-0029924 we drowned our pride i must tell you which was really serious and we seized the
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W-0042763-0043469 but i knew that to capture something that had never been seen before had never been documented and i do believe you should stay with us
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W-0058166-0058916 that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else's car it might not turn out the same way she might get shot for that
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W-0069566-0070616 wanting to play but she was also a predator needing to kill and yet conflicted in some way because she was also an emerging mother she had this maternal instinct
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W-0081560-0082640 it used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin but now throughout rituals and ceremonies traditional healers and ministers and of course looking at
BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W-0093629-0094954 if they disappear all of that goes away but what i'm more concerned about in many ways is that as we de link ourselves from nature as we de link ourselves spiritually from these animals we

BillDavenhall_2009P-0019125-0020066 in unequal quantities nineteen years of this and if you've been in that part of the country this is what those piles of burning smoldering coal waste look like
BillDavenhall_2009P-0027286-0027517 doctor can i remember ever asking me
BillDavenhall_2009P-0031526-0031969 anybody boy you're lucky how many have spent it in the red places
BillDavenhall_2009P-0039338-0040759 our cellphones can now build a place history this is how paul did it he did it with his iphone this might be what we end up with this is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room
BillDavenhall_2009P-0051691-0052463 that was what the conclusion of the dartmouth atlas of healthcare was about with saying that we can explain the geographic variations
BillDoyle_2011P-0009993-0011615 first of all electric fields are not an electric current that is coursing through the tissue electric fields are not ionizing radiation like x rays or proton beams that bombard tissue to disrupt dna
BillDoyle_2011P-0021132-0021872 importantly those special proteins are among the most highly charged objects in our body
BillDoyle_2011P-0032092-0033738 and we can observe this what i'm going to show you next are two in vitro experiments this is cultures identical cultures of cervical cancer cells and we've stained these cultures with a green florescent dye so that we can look
BillDoyle_2011P-0044789-0045969 the first cancer that we have focused on is the deadly brain cancer gbm gbm affects about ten thousand people in the u s each year
BillDoyle_2011P-0057636-0058277 so i'm going to show you now one of the patients from this trial
BillDoyle_2011P-0079458-0080443 she underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy over two years none of which had an effect her cancer continued to grow
BillFord_2011-0003867-0004642 triples or even quadruples my life is guided by two great passions and the first is automobiles
BillFord_2011-0017045-0018697 and it really struck me as the years went by in a very negative way when i would go to some stream that i'd loved and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it
BillFord_2011-0029347-0030361 i was considered a radical and i'll never forget the day i was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists
BillFord_2011-0042133-0043749 when we look at the population growth in terms of cars it becomes even clearer today there are about eight hundred million cars on the road worldwide but with more people and greater prosperity around the world that number's going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid century
BillFord_2011-0052944-0053986 and our ability to deliver food and health care particularly to people that live in city centers and our quality of life is going to be severely compromised
BillFord_2011-0064807-0066057 from about an hour today at rush hour to about twenty minutes now if you look at hong kong they have a very interesting system called octopus there it's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets
BillFord_2011-0072023-0073730 so if the car ahead of me on i ninety four hits traffic it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way and these systems are being tested right now and frankly they're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon
BillFord_2011-0079433-0080181 into a single system so i think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution to this enormous problem
BillFord_2011-0085593-0086952 embrace the green energy challenge and it's really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power how much money and how much serious thought has really over the last three years just poured into the green energy field
BillFord_2011-0096604-0097942 what we've really come to take for granted which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world and it frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this because if you can envision as i do
BillGates_2009-0009821-0010689 five years ago one hundred and thirty five million children were born so more and less than ten million of them died before the age of five
BillGates_2009-0026536-0027218 for example there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria
BillGates_2009-0037805-0039146 and so you end up with two choices if you go into a country with the right tools and the right way you do it vigorously you can actually get a local eradication and that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking
BillGates_2009-0050307-0051389 well all of us here i'll bet had some great teachers we all had a wonderful education that's part of the reason we're here today part of the reason we're successful
BillGates_2009-0062538-0062969 and even if you graduate from high school
BillGates_2009-0070697-0071515 for two years had top quartile teachers the entire difference between us and asia would go away
BillGates_2009-0085887-0086755 and what goes on is great teaching they take the poorest kids and over ninety six percent of their high school graduates go
BillGates_2009-0096203-0097237 crap and the management is told hey you can only come down here once a year but you need to let us know because we might actually fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment
BillGates_2009-0108432-0108999 and so by thinking of this as a personnel system we can do it much better
BillGates_2011U-0002856-0003510 state budgets are big big money i'll show you the numbers
BillGates_2011U-0018825-0019185 to hide that actually obscure the topic so much
BillGates_2011U-0028185-0028414 they defer the payments
BillGates_2011U-0045147-0045596 microsoft thirty eight google about nineteen
BillGates_2011U-0055764-0055942 than their assumptions
BillGates_2013S-0004192-0004385 that's how we improve
BillGates_2013S-0010169-0010405 our teachers deserve better
BillGates_2013S-0023005-0023429 some teachers are far more effective than others
BillGates_2013S-0034629-0035965 my name is sarah brown wessling i am a high school english teacher at johnston high school in johnston iowa turn to somebody next to you tell them what you think i mean when i talk about moves to prove i've talk about i think that there is a difference for teachers between
BillGates_2013S-0050356-0051316 if you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions
BillGates_2013S-0059654-0060104 it would also make us a more fair and just one too
BillGross_2003-0013794-0015235 i started looking at how we could build battery back up systems that could give people five hours ten hours maybe even a full day or three days worth of back up power i'm glad you heard earlier today batteries are unbelievably energy lack of density compared to fuel
BillGross_2003-0030370-0031418 they take all the parallel incoming rays and focus it to a single spot they have to track the sun because they have to be pointing directly at the sun they usually have about a one degree acceptance angle meaning once they're more than about a degree off
BillGross_2003-0043959-0044854 so we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to try and convert sunlight to electricity or heat to electricity and one of the great ones of all time
BillGross_2003-0055412-0056719 looking at these three and forty seven others we concluded that the stirling engine would be the best one to use i want to give you a brief explanation of how we looked at it and how it works so we tried to look at the stirling engine in a new way because
BillGross_2003-0061141-0062209 so we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to make that concentrator which didn't work out for us to optimize the stirling engine and make its design sizes and all of its dimensions
BillGross_2003-0076238-0076818 it led to a very compact inexpensive engine and this is what the engine looks like let me show you what it looks like in real life
BillGross_2003-0096541-0097966 it could be on your roof or in your backyard or somewhere else you don't have to have enough units to power your entire house you just save money with each incremental one you add so you're still using the grid potentially in this type of application to be your back up supply of course you can't use these at night
BillGross_2003-0116456-0117601 basically oil is solar energy concentrate it's been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy to make it have all that energy contained in it and we don't have a birthright to just use that up as fast as we are i think
BillJoy_2006-0013134-0014128 fact that these new technologies tend to be digital we saw genome sequences you can download the gene sequences of pathogens off the internet
BillJoy_2006-0027277-0028170 and then i signed a book contract to write more gloomy thoughts about this and moved into a hotel room in new york with one room full of books on the plague
BillJoy_2006-0040201-0040972 some of these big problems things where you know a factor of ten difference can make a factor of a thousand difference in the outcome
BillJoy_2006-0052770-0053629 when they took the apple mac interface and they put it back on the apple ii the apple ii was perfectly capable of running that kind of interface we just didn't know how to do it
BillJoy_2006-0064340-0064813 their strength they're almost the strongest material tensile strength material known
BillJoy_2006-0071100-0071835 if you put particles in them and they go shooting out the tip they're like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns the inside
BillJoy_2006-0084620-0085455 a lot of gaps and so we asked ourselves you know can we find innovative things that will go fill these gaps and
BillJoy_2006-0100190-0101407 so that people who are doing things that had a higher cost of catastrophe would have to take insurance against that risk so if you wanted to put a drug on the market you could put it on but it wouldn't have to be approved by regulators you'd have to convince an actuary
BillStone_2007-0001663-0002640 the world's deepest natural abyss and i say believe because this process is still ongoing right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that i'll talk a little bit about
BillStone_2007-0016297-0016521 descend into huautla plateau in mexico
BillStone_2007-0025708-0026757 for exploring places like this this is some life support equipment closed cycle and you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally underwater and to depths of two hundred meters straight down underwater
BillStone_2007-0043163-0043287 when you reach the surface
BillStone_2007-0062286-0063160 this may we're going to go from minus one thousand meters in zacaton and if we're very lucky depthx will bring back the first robotically discovered division of bacteria
BillStone_2007-0074814-0075028 ten thousand dollars for that in orbit
BillStone_2007-0085589-0086526 to just about everything bob bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit we can go much further we can build space tugs orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water
BillStone_2007-0099472-0099673 by putting a stake in the sand at ted
BillStrickland_2002-0002333-0002481 the only thing standing between you
BillStrickland_2002-0013456-0013863 he drove me out to the university of pittsburgh where i filled out a college application
BillStrickland_2002-0022529-0022860 and last year i spoke at his memorial service
BillStrickland_2002-0036444-0036581 we also
BillStrickland_2002-0045586-0045814 we believe in hope and human possibilities
BillStrickland_2002-0050580-0051466 and we're inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building and you could do us a great service if you would add a culinary program
BillStrickland_2002-0056026-0056191 and john heinz did give me a million
BillStrickland_2002-0067932-0068102 happens to be a curable condition
BillStrickland_2002-0075566-0075912 people can't learn world class technology what we've discovered
BillStrickland_2002-0086515-0086831 last year i put eighty eight percent of those kids in college and i've averaged over
BillStrickland_2002-0096493-0096628 teach photography
BillStrickland_2002-0105170-0105350 there is no statistical difference
BillStrickland_2002-0117772-0118056 so i just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes and
BillStrickland_2002-0129909-0130027 the greatest artists
BillStrickland_2002-0141906-0142173 was our first recording studio which was
BillStrickland_2002-0153461-0153487 that
BillStrickland_2002-0161693-0162014 and i built the first building and guess what happened
BillStrickland_2002-0168969-0169221 and herbie hancock was playing at our center that
BillStrickland_2002-0176601-0176782 slide show in the silicon valley
BillStrickland_2002-0183801-0184030 and i went down into the neighborhood
BillStrickland_2002-0191730-0191756 and
BillStrickland_2002-0198589-0198861 i believe in your intelligence and i believe in your
BillStrickland_2002-0201018-0201558 and pennsylvania it costs sixty thousand dollars to keep people in jail most of whom look like me
BillStrickland_2002-0207432-0207875 in my business it's very difficult work you're always fighting upstream like
BillyCollins_2012-0003749-0003942 and i love saying that
BillyCollins_2012-0017830-0019036 so let us start with the first one it's a little poem called budapest and in it i reveal or pretend to reveal the secrets of the creative
BillyCollins_2012-0036258-0036475 with your little plastic
BillyCollins_2012-0047813-0048210 where you will join those who have forgotten even how to swim
BillyCollins_2012-0070617-0072262 drugged perhaps by the hum of a warm afternoon they think we are looking back at them which makes them lift their oars and fall silent and wait like parents for us to close our eyes
BillyCollins_2012-0081419-0082082 after you come out of your room and begin to blossom or at least pick up all your socks
BillyGraham_1998-0005205-0006198 i was preaching in san jose some time ago and my friend mark kvamme who helped introduce me to this conference
BillyGraham_1998-0011043-0011204 because he made that decision
BillyGraham_1998-0019840-0019863 man
BillyGraham_1998-0026474-0026764 and some other problems that i won't talk about
BillyGraham_1998-0034829-0034986 but david changed all of
BillyGraham_1998-0042636-0042986 the first one that david saw was human evil
BillyGraham_1998-0048515-0048621 our battleships
BillyGraham_1998-0056484-0056696 within our hearts and our souls
BillyGraham_1998-0062608-0062827 easier to denature plutonium
BillyGraham_1998-0065441-0065728 the oklahoma city bombing was simple technology
BillyGraham_1998-0068756-0068880 the bible teaches
BillyGraham_1998-0073541-0074146 oxford i've spoken at all of those universities i'm going to harvard in about three or four no it's about two months from now
BillyGraham_1998-0081534-0081920 that's what we talked about and it was a stimulating conversation
BillyGraham_1998-0090764-0090916 which i do sometimes
BillyGraham_1998-0095908-0096188 problem that david knew he could not solve was death
BillyGraham_1998-0101145-0101427 a joint session of congress last year
BillyGraham_1998-0107786-0107984 and yet a few years earlier
BillyGraham_1998-0114702-0115019 in the aftermath of world war ii concluded quote
BillyGraham_1998-0121289-0121527 and he once and he said to me he said young man
BillyGraham_1998-0127618-0127741 he is viewed by many as the
BillyGraham_1998-0133516-0133766 to jesus christ my redeemer
BillyGraham_1998-0139188-0139562 open yourself to his love you lose nothing even if you're wrong
BillyGraham_1998-0146227-0146482 i was born and reared on a farm in north carolina
BillyGraham_1998-0150940-0151064 or he was insane
BirkeBaehr_2010X-0005978-0006090 was this is not
BirkeBaehr_2010X-0029497-0030399 and that my friends is how we can make a difference one kid at a time so next time you're at the grocery store think local choose organic know your farmer and know your
BjarkeIngels_2009G-0006681-0007518 which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes in this case it's mies van der rohe's less is more he triggered the modernist revolution
BjarkeIngels_2009G-0014304-0015212 at each meeting there's way too many ideas only the best ones can survive and through a process of architectural selection we might choose a really beautiful model
BjarkeIngels_2009G-0026118-0026983 so we lost but then we had a meeting with a chinese businessman who saw our design and said wow that's the chinese character for the word people
BjarkeIngels_2009G-0044355-0045286 and we noticed that this is like a shanghai street thirty years ago all bikes no cars this is how it looks today all traffic jam bicycles have become forbidden many places
BjarkeIngels_2009G-0062636-0063303 but to conclude if you want to see the mermaid from may to december next year don't come to copenhagen because she's going to be in shanghai
BjarkeIngels_2009G-0075992-0077414 the facade of the parking we wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated so we needed to perforate it and we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes we could actually turn the entire facade into a gigantic naturally ventilated rasterized image
BjarkeIngels_2009G-0089984-0090786 and he got very excited by this idea that you could actually make mountains out of architecture because azerbaijan is known as the alps of central asia
BjarkeIngels_2009G-0103995-0104551 of the two first mountains in what's going to be the first carbon neutral island in
BjornLomborg_2005-0011390-0011954 in davos in january but of course there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems because
BjornLomborg_2005-0026085-0026994 have a pizza you've no idea what the price is it could be at one dollar it could be one thousand dollars it could be a family size pizza it could be a very individual size pizza right we'd like to know these things
BjornLomborg_2005-0036302-0037560 projects where if you invest a dollar you get less than a dollar back then there's fair projects good projects and very good projects and of course it's the very good projects we should start doing i'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best
BjornLomborg_2005-0047794-0049070 it's just simply not our first priority the fair projects notice i'm not going to comment on all these but communicable diseases scale of basic health services just made it simply because yes scale of basic health services is a great thing it would do a lot of
BjornLomborg_2005-0060547-0061577 to focus on hiv aids basically if we invest twenty seven billion dollars over the next eight years we could avoid twenty eight new million cases of hiv aids
BjornLomborg_2005-0071627-0072431 one hundred will be about as rich as we are today much more likely they will be two to four times richer than we are and of course we'll be even richer than that
BjornLomborg_2005-0079409-0080328 we have you know the day after tomorrow it looks great right it's a good film in the sense that i certainly want to see it right but don't expect emmerich
BjornLomborg_2005-0093696-0094611 to get us to start thinking about priorities and saying what is the important thing in the world of course in an ideal world again we'd love to do everything but if we don't do it
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2010-0011231-0012058 but i'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff so we see the imagery of course not stopping
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2010-0016019-0017282 then the fact that that transition looks as it does is a function of all of that geometry all of that three d understanding behind this model now i'll show you a fun app
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2010-0026702-0027519 and from here we're able to do the same sorts of registration not only of still images but also
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2010-0040710-0042079 the market all right and now there's one last ted talk that microsoft has given in the past several years and that's curtis wong worldwide telescope so we're going to head over to the dumpsters where it's traditional after a long day at the market
BoazAlmog_2012G-0010340-0011073 and they dissipate this energy in the form of heat and you know that effect however
BoazAlmog_2012G-0023421-0023936 dissipate energy which breaks the superconductivity state
BoazAlmog_2012G-0033752-0034554 the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet why because as long as it rotates
BoazAlmog_2012G-0045900-0046369 freely moves in this new position
BobMankoff_2013S-0009003-0009534 but like i said you cannot satisfy everyone you couldn't satisfy this guy
BobMankoff_2013S-0033162-0034060 at a certain point this rejection slip in one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven we regret that we are unable to use the enclosed material thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider it magically changed to this
BobMankoff_2013S-0054754-0056091 he's the critic he's the critic of humor and really i'm forced to be in that position when i'm at the new yorker and that's the danger that i will become
BobMankoff_2013S-0091096-0092657 the great sam gross cartoon this happened after the muhammad controversy where it's muhammad in heaven the suicide bomber is all in little pieces and he's saying to the suicide bomber you'll get the virgins when we find your penis
BobMankoff_2013S-0119206-0119531 we understand that it's absurd but we're putting the two together
BobThurman_2006S-0011722-0012421 and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets so they don't when they look out and they see those lights that you showed in the sky
BobThurman_2006S-0023688-0024100 and of course we all will be deeply disappointed when we do
BobThurman_2006S-0034439-0035285 you surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way through art through meditation through understanding
BobThurman_2006S-0048771-0049315 like this or like that or what you know and the more you focus on how you feel by the way the worse it gets
BobThurman_2006S-0060335-0061164 because when you open up like that then you can't just what good does it do to add being miserable with others misery
BobThurman_2006S-0065372-0066252 jim's brain is memorizing the almanac but he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is he will he did
BobbyGhosh_2012X-0004855-0005923 in that original idea the concept of jihad is as important to muslims as the idea of grace is to christians
BobbyGhosh_2012X-0023147-0024606 but he told me that after nine eleven he began to have second thoughts he worried that if he called her by that name especially outdoors outside in public he might be seen as endorsing bin laden's idea of jihad
BobbyGhosh_2012X-0048858-0049480 they're not fighting a global jihad they're fighting battles over much narrower issues
BobbyGhosh_2012X-0064850-0065613 there lie the answers to the solution to local jihad who killed bin ladenism let's start with bin laden himself
BobbyGhosh_2012X-0089473-0090217 technical support for training for their police forces to become more effective for their anti terror forces to become more
BoghumaKabisenTitanji_2012X-0007643-0008367 she was unable to tell me the names of the drugs she'd received during the trial or even what the trial had been about
BoghumaKabisenTitanji_2012X-0024380-0025717 and in the absence of good health care systems almost any offer of medical assistance is accepted as better than nothing even more problematic reasons include lower risk of litigation
BoghumaKabisenTitanji_2012X-0035903-0037024 local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials as well as the incentives for participation
BoghumaKabisenTitanji_2012X-0050657-0051577 the final point i would like for you to consider tonight is what happens to participants in the clinical trial once the research has been completed
BoghumaKabisenTitanji_2012X-0063126-0063460 if you come from a developing country like myself
BonnieBassler_2009-0012835-0014044 they digest our food they make our vitamins they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out so they do all these amazing things that help us and are vital for keeping us alive
BonnieBassler_2009-0028470-0029348 and when the molecule hits a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light
BonnieBassler_2009-0043298-0044401 and what we found so this is supposed to be again my bacterial cell is that vibrio fischeri has a protein that's the red box it's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule the red triangle
BonnieBassler_2009-0054802-0055808 that's how it works we also then went to look at what are these molecules these were the red triangles on my slides before this is the vibrio fischeri molecule this is the word that it talks with
BonnieBassler_2009-0071728-0073034 we got that far we started to learn that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language but what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well i've told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors they communicate
BonnieBassler_2009-0086897-0088259 in the same time we give our anti quorum sensing molecule in fact the animal lives we think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it's going to get us around at least initially this big problem of resistance
BonnieBassler_2009-0093767-0094740 we know that the principles and the rules if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well
BonnieBassler_2009-0101453-0102839 is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you in the hopes of making you more healthy making those conversations better so bacteria can do things that we want them to do better than they would be on their own
Bono_2005-0011918-0012457 and a couple of bucks for a blank dvd imagination has been
Bono_2005-0022975-0023586 big shining continent beautiful royal people anybody who ever gave anything
Bono_2005-0033624-0033713 an emergency
Bono_2005-0044807-0046104 africa is a continent in flames and deep down if we really accepted that africans were equal to us we would all do more to put the fire out we're standing around with watering cans
Bono_2005-0057560-0058745 and it's real it's not spin it's not wishful thinking the problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world a chance to re describe ourselves to the world
Bono_2005-0068473-0069482 well much more than we think we can't fix every problem but the ones we can i want to argue we must and because we can we must
Bono_2005-0081807-0082142 most of you did the digital world well now
Bono_2005-0087298-0088657 i'm not a hippie and i'm not really one for the warm fuzzy feeling i do not have flowers in my hair actually i come from punk rock the clash wore big army boots not
Bono_2005-0094025-0095151 it's based on our belief that the action of one person can change a lot but the actions of many coming together as one can change the world
Bono_2005-0104483-0105889 what i try to communicate and you can help me if you agree is that aid for africa is just great value for money at a time when america really needs it putting it in the crassest possible terms
Bono_2005-0118383-0118944 where you live in the world should not determine whether you live
Bono_2005-0127088-0127720 wishes most of them impossible some of them impractical and one or two of them certainly immoral
Bono_2005-0137311-0138172 who are ready to make phone calls who are ready to be on email i am absolutely sure that we can actually change the course
Bono_2005-0150302-0151278 please join us by working together americans have an unprecedented opportunity we can make history we can start to make poverty history
Bono_2013-0001637-0002856 anderson asked me if i could put the last twenty five years of anti poverty campaigning into ten minutes for ted that's an englishman asking an irishman to be succinct
Bono_2013-0014588-0015366 liberty is usually around the corner even for the poorest of the poor facts that can challenge cynicism and the apathy
Bono_2013-0018607-0018985 my usual tricks the only thing singing today
Bono_2013-0024469-0025822 for kids under five child mortality kids under five it's down by two point six five million a year that's a rate of seven thousand two hundred and fifty six children's lives saved each day
Bono_2013-0036406-0036580 this is not just data
Bono_2013-0043443-0044812 now i know that some of you think this progress is all in asia or latin america or model countries like brazil and who doesn't love a brazilian model but look at sub saharan africa
Bono_2013-0054798-0055542 down towards zero just doing the things that we know work so inertia versus momentum there is jeopardy
Bono_2013-0064700-0065374 all across uganda young people armed with two g phones an sms social network
Bono_2013-0073678-0074196 you will join us and countless others in what i truly believe
Bono_2013-0081902-0082067 than the people in power
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X-0016366-0016744 and i was at a dinner part of the job of it when you're a chair of a department is to
BrendaBrathwaite_2011X-0032037-0032457 and she's treating it like basically some black people went on a cruise
BrendaLaurel_1998-0004228-0004526 having ideas that people didn't think they could sell
BrendaLaurel_1998-0013884-0014428 we spent two and a half years conducting research we spent another year and a half in advance development
BrendaLaurel_1998-0029958-0030695 that has now served twenty five million pages and has forty two thousand registered young girl users who spend
BrendaLaurel_1998-0042568-0043002 it's funny to me that these interesting odd bedfellows have one thing in common
BrendaLaurel_1998-0051353-0051410 you
BrendaLaurel_1998-0068831-0069813 girls their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility and to play around with the social complexity of their lives
BreneBrown_2010X-0006506-0006911 let me think about this for a second i tried to call deep on my courage
BreneBrown_2010X-0011978-0012459 here's the thing if you cannot measure it it does not exist and
BreneBrown_2010X-0017693-0017799 i thought you know what
BreneBrown_2010X-0029374-0029506 be worthy of connection
BreneBrown_2010X-0038021-0039251 my one year turned into six years thousands of stories hundreds of long interviews focus groups at one point people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories
BreneBrown_2010X-0048999-0050373 whole hearted these are whole hearted people living from this deep sense of worthiness so i wrote at the top of the manila folder and i started looking at the data in fact i did it first in a four day
BreneBrown_2010X-0059803-0060239 believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful
BreneBrown_2010X-0071611-0071829 and they're like i'm just saying you know
BreneBrown_2010X-0084001-0084295 that's not me and b i don't even hang out with people like
BreneBrown_2010X-0093578-0093664 the most in debt
BreneBrown_2010X-0101121-0101207 one of the things
BreneBrown_2010X-0110567-0111271 that's our job show me a generation of kids raised like that and we'll end the problems i think that we see today we pretend
BreneBrown_2012-0006556-0006889 as absolutely essential to whole hearted living
BreneBrown_2012-0022898-0023399 but i want to talk about what i've learned there's two things that i've learned in the last year
BreneBrown_2012-0033269-0033647 we'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention vulnerability or shame
BreneBrown_2012-0042342-0042734 feet away this is what i hear vulnerability ted vulnerability ted
BreneBrown_2012-0058008-0058264 from studying vulnerability
BreneBrown_2012-0065180-0065502 they also teach them how to stitch their self worth
BreneBrown_2012-0071820-0072094 because very few people here are afraid to fail
BreneBrown_2012-0076859-0077279 but when he fails when he loses he does so daring greatly
BreneBrown_2012-0087306-0088181 shame is highly highly correlated with addiction depression violence aggression bullying suicide eating disorders
BreneBrown_2012-0097951-0098295 conflicting competing expectations about who we're supposed to be
BreneBrown_2012-0107179-0107410 can't do it all anymore
BreneBrown_2012-0114573-0114803 if you put shame in a petri dish
BreneBrown_2012-0120192-0120365 we want you to go in
BrewsterKahle_2007P-0009188-0009864 and achieve something and i'm going to try to argue only one point today that universal access to all knowledge
BrewsterKahle_2007P-0021545-0022996 they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books and that's kind of fun and you can download these things and look around them in new and different ways and you can get at them remotely if you happen to have a laptop there's starting to be some of these
BrewsterKahle_2007P-0033399-0034605 so the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper where i can handle sort of sounds a little retro but i think it still has its place and being sort of from the silicon valley sort of utopia and sort of you know
BrewsterKahle_2007P-0045874-0046621 and we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it and it turns out that two hundred dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them
BrewsterKahle_2007P-0057898-0058644 and with two digital high grade professional digital cameras controlled museum lighting so even if it's a black and white book
BrewsterKahle_2007P-0069545-0070391 so i think of we're kind of going from the out of copyright library stuff and amazon com is coming from the in print world
BrewsterKahle_2007P-0080597-0081798 cds or at least that's the largest archives of published materials we've been able to sort of point at it costs about ten dollars a piece to go and take a disk and put it online if you're doing things in volume
BrewsterKahle_2007P-0096795-0097424 sort of the biggest tivo box you've ever seen it's about a petabyte so far of worldwide television
BrewsterKahle_2007P-0116370-0117373 in the future just as we basically benefited as we were growing up so universal access to all knowledge i think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind
BrianCox_2008-0009729-0011117 those magnets are in there and again an eu standard size real person so you get some sense of the scale and it's in there that those mini big bangs will be created sometime in the summer this year and actually this morning i got an email saying that we've just finished today
BrianCox_2008-0018485-0019414 are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe back at the start in the first billionth of a second we believe or we've observed it was very simple
BrianCox_2008-0030117-0031023 so this thing was discovered in the year two thousand so it's a relatively recent picture one of the wonderful things actually i find is that we've discovered any of them when you realize how tiny
BrianCox_2008-0042263-0042924 basically each of these terms refers to some of the particles so those ws there refer to the ws and how they stick together
BrianCox_2008-0058816-0059841 so the electromagnetic force the force that holds us together gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures the strong force the strong nuclear force which sticks nuclei together gets weaker
BrianCox_2008-0075665-0076543 so the elements of life carbon and oxygen and iron all the elements that we need to make us up were cooked in those first generations of stars
BrianCox_2010S-0003694-0004521 so i want to try and convince you in about fifteen minutes that that's a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do but i think to set the scene
BrianCox_2010S-0018708-0019828 that's fascinating and beautiful in itself but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon
BrianCox_2010S-0036998-0038124 well a solid immovable kind of indestructible place but as a very small fragile looking world just hanging against the blackness of space what's also not often
BrianCox_2010S-0059113-0060277 imposed on the mass of stars you can work it out on a piece of paper in laboratory get a telescope swing it to the sky and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than one point four times the mass of the sun
BrianCox_2010S-0067067-0068052 and then it explodes and it explodes and it shines as brightly as a billion suns for about two weeks and releases not only energy but a huge amount of
BrianCox_2010S-0078176-0078839 but actually because of a tiny faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings and if i blow it up there you see
BrianCox_2010S-0097091-0098034 that our views of science are ultimate that our triumphs are complete that there are no mysteries in nature and that there are no new worlds to conquer thank you
BrianGoldman_2011X-0038393-0038755 in fact so lacking in confidence was i that
BrianGoldman_2011X-0085243-0085523 believe me i'd have trouble making eye
BrianGreene_2005-0002452-0003454 a very bold and in some ways a very bizarre idea he proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions
BrianGreene_2005-0015687-0016369 so einstein found that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself the idea goes like this
BrianGreene_2005-0031263-0032180 he found the old equations that einstein had already derived in three dimensions those were for gravity but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension
BrianGreene_2005-0041433-0042292 but you and i all know that it does have some thickness it's very hard to see it though from far away but if we zoom in and take the perspective of say a little ant walking around
BrianGreene_2005-0047310-0047910 this is the idea you could have additional curled up dimensions here is a little shape of a circle so small that we don't see them
BrianGreene_2005-0053058-0053963 detail it didn't work in detail for instance they couldn't get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory so many people worked on it but by the
BrianGreene_2005-0065403-0066416 these ideas are correct this is what the ultra microscopic landscape of the universe looks like it's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments
BrianGreene_2005-0074982-0075372 that is true one of the other predictions of string theory
BrianGreene_2005-0086109-0087211 and klein this is what string theory says about the extra dimensions they have a very rich intertwined geometry this is an example of something known as a calabi yau shape
BrianGreene_2005-0097501-0097734 now the second issue that i want to finish up with
BrianGreene_2005-0109001-0109783 by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions than when we began this will show that the extra dimensions are real
BrianGreene_2012-0009103-0010334 that would rightly be called universes of their own and yet speculative though the idea surely is i aim to convince you that there's reason for taking it seriously as it just might be right
BrianGreene_2012-0023866-0024959 well the most promising answer comes from an old idea of einstein's you see we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing
BrianGreene_2012-0039312-0040880 to realize einstein's dream of a unified theory of physics a single overarching framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work in the universe and the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward it says that
BrianGreene_2012-0054116-0054398 of the extra dimensions all we have
BrianGreene_2012-0066847-0067336 which means we have been asking the wrong question
BrianGreene_2012-0077291-0077777 who was obsessed with understanding a different number why the sun
BrianGreene_2012-0090144-0091931 it tells us how the universe evolved after the bang but gives us no insight into what would have powered the bang itself and this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the big bang theory it's called inflationary cosmology which identified
BrianGreene_2012-0104382-0105155 the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide and if our universe got hit by another that collision
BrianGreene_2012-0120736-0121217 nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law
BrianSkerry_2010Z-0004971-0005585 but more and more frequently these days i'm seeing terrible things underwater as well things that i don't think most people realize
BrianSkerry_2010Z-0011364-0012344 killed with hakapiks at about eight fifteen days old it actually is the largest marine mammal slaughter on the planet with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year
BrianSkerry_2010Z-0018780-0019757 so i proposed a story on the global fish crisis in part because i had personally witnessed a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last thirty years but also because i read a scientific paper
BrianSkerry_2010Z-0032055-0033065 but as you can imagine it's catching everything else in its path as well and it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom things like sponges and corals that critical habitat for other animals
BrianSkerry_2010Z-0046807-0047886 got to that goal where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose and my strobe created a shadow on her face and i think it's a gentler picture a little less threatening a little more respectful of the species
BrianSkerry_2010Z-0059922-0061054 these are animals whose lineage dates back about one hundred million years and there was a time in their lifespan where they were coming out of the water to nest and saw tyrannosaurus rex running by and today they crawl out and see condominiums
BrianSkerry_2010Z-0082140-0083665 i settled on working in the country of new zealand because new zealand was rather progressive and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean and i really wanted this story to be about three things i wanted it to be about abundance about diversity and about resilience and one of the first places i worked was
BrittaRiley_2011X-0001620-0002200 like many of you am one of the two billion people on earth
BrittaRiley_2011X-0016213-0017084 now light and temperature vary with each window's microclimate so a window farm requires a farmer
BrittaRiley_2011X-0030697-0031930 and window farmers in finland have been customizing their window farms for the dark days of the finnish winters by outfitting them with led grow lights that they're now making open source and part of the project
BruceAylward_2011-0003829-0005279 now i bet in this audience you're thinking of some really incredible technology some stuff that i haven't even heard of i'm absolutely sure but i'm also sure pretty sure that absolutely nobody is thinking of this
BruceAylward_2011-0014547-0015481 this wasn't the case everywhere in the world and it happened so fast in the united states however that even just last month jon stewart said
BruceAylward_2011-0029661-0030120 we're not trying to control polio we're not trying to get it down to just a few cases
BruceAylward_2011-0042404-0042584 is that when we started trying
BruceAylward_2011-0059151-0060940 and these heroes they come from every walk of life all sorts of backgrounds but one of the most extraordinary is rotary international this is a group whose million strong army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over twenty years they're right at the center of the whole thing
BruceAylward_2011-0072742-0074417 and then to make the matters even worse the virus started to spread out of these four places especially northern india and northern nigeria into much of africa asia and even into europe causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades
BruceAylward_2011-0089994-0090596 we think children deserve better and so
BruceAylward_2011-0104683-0105672 now here at ted over the last couple of days i've seen people challenging the audience again and again to believe in the impossible
BruceAylward_2011-0115179-0116581 we have major challenges you can imagine to finish this job but as you've also seen it's doable it has great secondary benefits and polio eradication is a great buy
BruceAylward_2011-0123639-0124716 we have the chance to write an entirely new polio free chapter in human history but if we blink now
BruceBuenodeMesquita_2009-0006934-0007698 now before i get into how to do it let me give you a little truth in advertising because i'm not engaged in the business of magic
BruceBuenodeMesquita_2009-0017245-0018035 and they face limitations constraints they may be weak they may be located in the wrong part of the world they may be einstein
BruceBuenodeMesquita_2009-0030850-0031770 problem but lets face it the secretary of state doesn't know much about iran the secretary of defense doesn't know much about iran each of those people in turn
BruceBuenodeMesquita_2009-0043171-0044022 they can they don't need coffee breaks they don't need vacations they don't need to go to sleep at night
BruceBuenodeMesquita_2009-0055713-0056610 they're careerists they also care about getting credit there's ego involvement they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome
BruceBuenodeMesquita_2009-0067078-0067218 turn to iran let me make
BruceBuenodeMesquita_2009-0078614-0079366 changing its behavior various players in the united states and egypt and saudi arabia and russia european union japan so on and so forth
BruceBuenodeMesquita_2009-0090772-0091451 and by the way this was done a while ago before the current economic crisis and that's probably going to get steeper these
BruceBuenodeMesquita_2009-0099757-0100766 the reason that being able to predict those things is important is not just because you might run a hedge fund and make money off of it but because if you can predict what people will do you
BruceBuenodeMesquita_2009-0112891-0112993 here's hoping they
BruceFeiler_2010P-0014184-0014772 that sent me to an x ray then to an mri and one afternoon i got a call from my doctor
BruceFeiler_2010P-0028514-0029645 in this culture i don't have to tell you that you sort of happy your way through a problem we should focus on the positive my wife as i said she grew up outside of boston she's got a big smile she's got a big personality she's got big hair
BruceFeiler_2010P-0045507-0046463 and then i asked him a question which i ended up asking to all the dads and ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book and that was what's the one piece of advice you would give to my girls
BruceFeiler_2010P-0059537-0059862 this is a surgery so rare only two human beings have survived
BruceFeiler_2010P-0070419-0071372 my wife and i had kids we thought it would be all hands on deck instead it was everybody running the other way and when i had cancer we thought it'd be everybody running the other way instead it was all hands on deck
BruceFeiler_2010P-0082847-0083562 and no one captures this modern manhood to me more than david black now david is my literary agent he's about five foot three and a half
BruceFeiler_2010P-0091024-0092085 so one day near the end of my journey i said come on girls let's take a walk across the brooklyn bridge we set out on crutches i was on crutches my wife was next to me my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead
BruceFeiler_2010P-0102368-0102736 year is called the jubilee year and it's the origin of that term
BruceFeiler_2010P-0110895-0111083 as you see now walking without crutches or
BruceFeiler_2013S-0007003-0007820 what would it be the parents predicted the kids would say spending more time with them they were wrong
BruceFeiler_2013S-0024603-0025531 sutherland wanted to create a system where ideas didn't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom and be adjusted in real time
BruceFeiler_2013S-0037189-0038030 fed the pets or whatever chores they had checked the list once more gathered their belongings and made their way to the bus it was one of the most astonishing
BruceFeiler_2013S-0051746-0052740 i think the time is right for an agile family manifesto i've taken some ideas from the starrs and from many other families i met i'm proposing three planks
BruceFeiler_2013S-0065813-0066646 be flexible be open minded let the best ideas win plank number two empower your children
BruceFeiler_2013S-0077087-0078960 i was talking to warren buffett's banker and he was chiding me for not letting my children make mistakes with their allowance and i said but what if they drive into a ditch he said it's much better to drive into a ditch with a dollar six allowance than a dollar sixty thousand a year salary or a dollar six million inheritance so the bottom line is empower
BruceFeiler_2013S-0086598-0087833 a few weeks later we got a call from the school one of our daughters had gotten into a spat and suddenly we were worried like do we have a mean girl on our hands and we didn't really know what to do so we called her into my office the family mission statement was on the wall and my wife said
BruceFeiler_2013S-0103618-0104722 almost anybody who's looked at well run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion greatness is not a matter of circumstance it's a matter of choice
BruceMcCall_2008P-0007050-0008073 the trick was to bang the golf ball off a suits of armor which you can't see there this was one of a series called zany afternoons which became a book this is a home built rocket propelled
BruceMcCall_2008P-0021896-0022672 couldn't wait for the invention of the helicopter but it should have it wasn't a big success it's the only spanish innovation technologically of the twentieth century by the way
BruceMcCall_2008P-0039223-0039443 and it's so safe it carries no insurance
BruceMcCall_2008P-0050771-0051524 if you live in new york you know how the bike messengers move except that he's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff they all do
BruceSchneier_2010X-0005734-0007314 you're always trading off something whether this is a personal decision whether you're going to install a burglar alarm in your home or a national decision where you're going to invade some foreign country you're going to trade off something either money or time convenience capabilities maybe fundamental liberties
BruceSchneier_2010X-0017931-0018357 us as a successful species on the planet you me everybody
BruceSchneier_2010X-0023658-0025352 now there are several biases in risk perception a lot of good experiments in this and you can see certain biases that come up again and again so i'll give you four we tend to exaggerate spectacular and rare risks and downplay common risks so flying versus driving
BruceSchneier_2010X-0029477-0030070 if a risk is thrust upon you terrorism was a good example you'll overplay it because you don't feel like it's in your control
BruceSchneier_2010X-0040677-0040934 i write a lot about security theater
BruceSchneier_2010X-0049417-0049602 well a poor understanding
BruceSchneier_2010X-0057007-0057377 because feeling is close to reality you don't need a model
BruceSchneier_2010X-0066839-0067341 airline safety car safety models can come from industry
BruceSchneier_2010X-0075804-0076073 models eventually fade into the background
BruceSchneier_2010X-0087943-0089354 and you see agenda this is marketing this is politics trying to convince you to have one model versus another trying to convince you to ignore a model and trust your feelings marginalizing people with models you don't like
BruceSchneier_2010X-0098473-0098729 so it's a very hard model to accept
BruceSchneier_2010X-0110093-0110544 the second more honest way is to actually fix the model
BruceSchneier_2010X-0122031-0122741 but if you think about it if you are a hospital and you need to take a baby away from its mother out of the room to run some tests
BryanStevenson_2012-0004024-0005548 that have impacts around the world and sometimes when it comes through ted it has meaning and power that it doesn't have when it doesn't and i mention that because i think identity is really important and we've had some fantastic presentations
BryanStevenson_2012-0017621-0018109 she took me out back and she said bryan i'm going to tell you something but you don't tell anybody what i tell you
BryanStevenson_2012-0027614-0027795 then he looked at me real hard and he said
BryanStevenson_2012-0039156-0039571 of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on probation or parole
BryanStevenson_2012-0048860-0049503 the other way of thinking about it is not do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit but do we deserve to kill
BryanStevenson_2012-0060382-0061058 and i believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation in south africa
BryanStevenson_2012-0065351-0065761 to in an intentional and deliberate way set about executing people
BryanStevenson_2012-0070584-0070912 the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated
BryanStevenson_2012-0078646-0078923 but also the dark and difficult things
BryanStevenson_2012-0093689-0095554 because ultimately our humanity depends on everyone's humanity i've learned very simple things doing the work that i do it's just taught me very simple things i've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done i believe that for every person on the planet
BryanStevenson_2012-0100441-0101019 we won't be judged by our intellect and reason ultimately you judge the character of a society
BryanStevenson_2012-0119650-0119998 and finally this older black man with this very worried look on his face
BunkerRoy_2011G-0001998-0002190 and i'd like to share
BunkerRoy_2011G-0012944-0013155 and dig wells for five years
BunkerRoy_2011G-0021784-0021950 they said please
BunkerRoy_2011G-0033503-0033676 the teacher is the learner
BunkerRoy_2011G-0040605-0041000 high powered paper qualified expert i said what can you
BunkerRoy_2011G-0051121-0051805 who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker it's a parabolic scheffler solar cooker
BunkerRoy_2011G-0061404-0061579 every five years
BunkerRoy_2011G-0078147-0078505 because there's no place it was all snowed up on both sides
BunkerRoy_2011G-0088944-0089156 you don't choose the spoken word
BunkerRoy_2011G-0110111-0110270 first they ignore you
BurtRutan_2006-0010567-0010752 what we're looking forward to
BurtRutan_2006-0014791-0015587 that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later that's the theme of my next fifteen minutes here
BurtRutan_2006-0022368-0023267 thousands of attempts in that four year time period we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today and that's why they're so safe as we gave it a lot of chance to
BurtRutan_2006-0033286-0033924 could build in their garages and some three thousand of these are flying of course one of them is around the world voyager
BurtRutan_2006-0046093-0047016 the very first year starting when gagarin went in space and a few weeks later alan shepherd there were five manned space flights in the world the very first year
BurtRutan_2006-0057328-0058314 be very high volume we think one hundred thousand people will fly by two thousand and twenty i can't tell you when this will start because i don't want my competition to know my schedule
BurtRutan_2006-0071941-0072853 as young children this little three to fifteen year old age by us going to orbit and going to the moon here right in this time period
BurtRutan_2006-0080227-0080970 and we're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late
BurtRutan_2006-0095794-0096790 go to the moon but you know would you have thought back in the sixties when the space race was going on that the first commercial capitalist like thing to do
BurtRutan_2006-0109769-0110072 and what that means is before we know
CKWilliams_2001-0003685-0004320 half a long century gone and still she comes at me with that thick cruel yellow bar
CKWilliams_2001-0012762-0012882 in those days
CKWilliams_2001-0023849-0024726 only later would i see the dresses also as a proclamation that in your dim kitchen your laundry
CKWilliams_2001-0034960-0035777 the worst anyway through the kiss and embrace bleeding from brother to brother into the generations
CKWilliams_2001-0046808-0047700 who till i left her played the same record and head on my shoulder hand on my thigh sang sweetly along
CKWilliams_2001-0059065-0060232 the last lost time i saw her when she came to find me at a party her drunkenly stumbling falling sprawling skirt hiked eyes veined red swollen with
CKWilliams_2001-0069866-0069982 gas
CKWilliams_2001-0083430-0084212 we regarded each other scrutinized one another me shyly obliquely trying not to be furtive
CKWilliams_2001-0088449-0089191 sometimes i'd think i should take her home with me bathe her comfort her dress her she wouldn't have wanted me to i would think
CKWilliams_2001-0093343-0093735 the dance of our glances challenge abdication
CKWilliams_2001-0104613-0105706 is that there's been so much premeditation where she is so much plotting and planning there's hardly a person where she is or if there is it's not her
CKWilliams_2001-0118233-0119003 coming of age in the american sensual darkness never seeing an unsmudged nipple an uncensored vagina
CKWilliams_2001-0128642-0129883 constantly conscious now of death moving towards me sometimes i think i confound them my wife's loveliness almost consumes me my passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds
CaitriaONeill_2012X-0005573-0007062 in massachusetts and i was cleverly standing in the front yard when one came over the hill after a lamppost flew by my family and i sprinted into the basement trees were thrown against the house the windows exploded when we finally got out the back door transformers were burning in the street
CaitriaONeill_2012X-0040379-0041021 now try to imagine the sinking feeling you get when you've just sent out two thousand volunteers and you can't prove it
CalebChung_2007P-0004934-0005697 to show you a little bit about the world of toy design at least from my small aperture of the world this is a this is a video i made when i first started
CalebChung_2007P-0019204-0020151 i started doing animatronics i loved dinosaurs i used to be in the film business kind of and actually nicholas negroponte saw this when i was like twelve and anyway so then they said no you have to make
CalebChung_2007P-0040327-0041623 and so i've always had a big interest in this this one actually didn't go anywhere but i got my feet wet doing this this is a smaller one and i have a little moving torso on there a little tiny guy walks along more servo drives lots of servo hacking lots of mechanical stuff
CalebChung_2007P-0062342-0063151 and that's how we sold him and hasbro actually said i meant tiger electronics at the time said yeah we want to do this we have you know
CalebChung_2007P-0077023-0078176 so i picked a camarasaurus because the camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in north america and you could actually find full fossil evidence of these that's a juvenile and so we actually went in there's a book
CalebChung_2007P-0091465-0091860 it's very painful so these
CalebChung_2007P-0100137-0100327 little creatures that you can love now these are
CameronHerold_2009X-0002927-0003960 and what i've been really passionate about ever since and i've never spoken about this ever until now so this is the first time anyone's ever heard it except my wife three days ago because she said what are you talking about and i told
CameronHerold_2009X-0018809-0019863 and the media says that it's really cool if we could go out and be a model or a singer or a sports hero like sidney crosby our mba programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs
CameronHerold_2009X-0039342-0039942 for coat hangers and my mom came into the room and she said where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners
CameronHerold_2009X-0047840-0048698 on the front of your wife's car and see if it lasts longer so i knew there were two cars with two license plates on each if i couldn't sell all four i could at least get one i learned that at a young age
CameronHerold_2009X-0057716-0058311 i got paid and i thought that was kind of cool strangely enough thirty years later we're building one eight hundred got junk and making money
CameronHerold_2009X-0072678-0073411 i packaged them up three ways i had the pinnacles and ddhs and the really cool ones back then those sold for two dollars each and then i had all the good ones that didn't look crappy
CameronHerold_2009X-0089584-0090766 a red shirt a blue tie a kangaroo and a laptop and have them tell a story about those four things my kids do that all the time it teaches them to sell it teaches them creativity it teaches them to think on their feet just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it
CameronRussell_2012X-0010830-0012233 i just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds and in this picture i had actually never had a boyfriend in real life i was totally uncomfortable and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand
CameronRussell_2012X-0028870-0030222 if the photographer is right there and the light is right there like a nice hmi and the client says cameron we want a walking shot well then this leg goes first nice and long this arm goes back this arm goes forward the head is at three quarters and you just go back and forth just do that and then you look
CameronRussell_2012X-0048443-0048777 that we never say on camera that i have never said on camera
CameronSinclair_2006-0008163-0009053 we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in kosovo and i didn't know what i was doing like i say mid twenties
CameronSinclair_2006-0024149-0025371 what happened is we used meetup and all these other kind of internet tools and we ended up having forty chapters starting up thousands of architects in one hundred and four countries
CameronSinclair_2006-0037223-0038021 emergency shelter but transitional shelter that would last five to ten years that would be placed next to the land the resident lived in
CameronSinclair_2006-0052527-0053587 if you have aids you also need to have nutrition rates and the idea that the idea of nutrition is as important as getting anti retrovirals out there so you know this is a serious solution
CameronSinclair_2006-0067307-0067353 and
CameronSinclair_2006-0077866-0078947 the kids actually get involved in mapping out where the the community center should be and then eventually the community is actually through skills training end up building the building with us
CameronSinclair_2006-0093879-0094573 it took twenty years to design this and get it implemented in the field i was twelve years old
CameronSinclair_2006-0106706-0107749 one in seven live in unplanned settlements if we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen in twenty years one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp
CameronSinclair_2006-0122242-0122882 when you look at the face of an architect most people think a gray haired white guy i don't see that i see the face of the world
CameronSinclair_2006-0134311-0134440 what happens
CameronSinclair_2006-0138754-0139272 i will give points for those who know it i think the man was
CameronSinclair_2009G-0006367-0007052 while it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities ninety nine percent of these people are hired by the private sector
CameronSinclair_2009G-0017338-0017777 let's not forget these men who are truly dying to work thank you
CamilleSeaman_2011U-0016203-0017445 the last pictures i'd like to show you are of an iceberg that i photographed in qeqetarsuaq greenland it's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling
CamilleSeaman_2013-0006919-0007513 i started storm chasing in two thousand and eight after my daughter said mom you should do that
CamilleSeaman_2013-0013304-0013553 and then there are the colors in the clouds
CandyChang_2012G-0003432-0004142 using simple tools like stickers stencils and chalk and these projects came from questions i had like
CandyChang_2012G-0016917-0017211 before i die i want to
CarlHonore_2005G-0001335-0002368 i'd like to start off with is an observation which is that if i've learned anything over the last year it's that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast
CarlHonore_2005G-0016182-0017225 my wake up call came when i started reading bedtime stories to my son and i found that at the end of day i would go into his room and i just couldn't slow down you know i'd be speed reading the cat
CarlHonore_2005G-0031368-0032131 moment of every day into a race to the finish line a finish line incidentally that we never reach but a finish line nonetheless
CarlHonore_2005G-0046660-0047995 which tend to tap into sort of slower gentler more holistic forms of healing now obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies and i personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever you know gain mainstream approval
CarlHonore_2005G-0059786-0060828 and norway sweden denmark and finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on earth and they work the kind of hours that would make the average american weep with envy
CarlHonore_2005G-0075591-0076774 telling them that they'll get more out of life and more out of harvard if they put on the brakes if they do less but give time to things the time that things need to enjoy them to savor them and even if they sometimes do nothing at all and that letter
CarlHonore_2005G-0091260-0092162 business press but also you know big companies and leadership organizations because people at the top of the chain people like you i think are starting to realize that there's too much
CarlHonore_2005G-0105550-0106719 the journey began and there too the news is rosy i you know at the end of the day i go into my son's room i don't wear a watch i switch off my computer so i can't hear the email pinging into the basket and i just
CarlSafina_2010X-0003990-0004039 by it
CarlSafina_2010X-0008569-0009465 and the same thing with the atmosphere if you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball you would get that little sphere of gas on the right so we live
CarlSafina_2010X-0014541-0015294 seven point five it dissolves in about three days if you take sea urchin larva from eight point one
CarlSafina_2010X-0029314-0030177 you see people who are really shell shocked they are very hardworking people all they know about life is they get up in the morning and if their engine starts they go to work
CarlSafina_2010X-0043417-0044230 dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene
CarlSafina_2010X-0060228-0061397 very much right in the area of the slick they're probably having at the very least a catastrophic spawning season this year i'm hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding that dirty water
CarlSafina_2010X-0075521-0076610 and i think you know that's a great name for boats that they're going to do anything to make a dent in this by dragging a boom between them when there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles
CarlSafina_2010X-0086507-0087306 it's really really important that we express our compassion i think that's the most important thing that people have is compassion
CarlSafina_2010X-0098160-0099334 so i think that the oil blowout the bank bailout the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause
CarlSafina_2010X-0114624-0115816 now are we stuck with this ever since we lived in caves every time we wanted any energy we lit something on fire and that is still what we're doing we're still lighting something on fire every time
CarlSchoonover_2012U-0010557-0012271 reveals the trees inside if everything had been labeled nothing would have been visible so somehow it shows what's there spanish neuroanatomist santiago ramon y cajal who's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience applied this golgi stain which yields data which looks like this and really gave us
CarlSchoonover_2012U-0024828-0025100 i'd like to leave you with the following thought
CarloRatti_2011-0017004-0018439 in a certain sense it's almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actuator and that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there in a certain sense it's almost as if
CarloRatti_2011-0033985-0035839 mac computer how they came together but we know very little about where things go so in this project we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system so we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in seattle just over a year ago
CarloRatti_2011-0067532-0067906 you can have a kind of flexible screen or display like this
CarloRatti_2011-0085284-0086218 over the past couple of decades we went from the physical world to the digital one this has been digitizing everything knowledge and making that accessible through the internet
CarmenAgraDeedy_2005-0007951-0008284 pearls of wisdom leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you
CarmenAgraDeedy_2005-0018038-0018729 because every one of us has this desire for once just once to tell our story and have it heard
CarmenAgraDeedy_2005-0022528-0022987 my cuban mother which i just briefly introduced you to in that short character sketch
CarmenAgraDeedy_2005-0028919-0029833 any vehicular outing with that woman from the time i was a young child guys naturally included flashing blue lights but she'd become adept at dodging
CarmenAgraDeedy_2005-0047015-0047222 she has been out and not been stopped so
CarmenAgraDeedy_2005-0058483-0058566 are we here today
CarmenAgraDeedy_2005-0067601-0067739 know that honey
CarmenAgraDeedy_2005-0083727-0083859 with the sheer force
CarmenAgraDeedy_2005-0094442-0094686 i gave it up with pantyhose they're both
CarneRoss_2009P-0001646-0002693 my story is a little bit about war it's about disillusionment it's about death and it's about rediscovering idealism
CarneRoss_2009P-0015601-0016393 as those numbers suggest i was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world
CarneRoss_2009P-0022321-0022901 dangerous and that was exciting that was fun it was really interesting and
CarneRoss_2009P-0029541-0030662 the resolution in the security council of the twelfth of september two thousand and one condemning the attacks of the day before which were of course deeply present to us actually living in new york at the time
CarneRoss_2009P-0039123-0040354 but they were random things one was that in the summer of two thousand and four the british government somewhat reluctantly decided to have an official inquiry into the use of intelligence on wmd in the run up to the iraq war
CarneRoss_2009P-0051514-0052454 a lot better than i like actually standing on top of the cliff wondering what to do a second thing happened in kosovo which kind of i need a quick gulf of water forgive me
CarneRoss_2009P-0062097-0062679 and the kosovo government let alone the kosovo people were not actually participating in those talks
CarneRoss_2009P-0076177-0076817 a bit of randomness here too because when i was beginning independent diplomat i went to a party in the house of lords which is a ridiculous place
CarneRoss_2009P-0086730-0087193 i don't know some lessons from all of this personal and political
CarneRoss_2009P-0095885-0096479 i can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the al shabaab militia in somalia
CarneRoss_2009P-0111441-0112403 if i'm going to spend the rest of my life lobbying for these crumby governments to do what needs to be done so what we're going to do is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves
CarneRoss_2009P-0117260-0118182 of course describing all this any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult and i entirely agree with you the chances of failure are very high
CarolineCasey_2010W-0003568-0003879 because they were all about being free
CarolineCasey_2010W-0012432-0012625 i learned the truth at seventeen
CarolineCasey_2010W-0031167-0033010 and that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and i would drive and for the next eleven years i swore nobody would ever find out that i couldn't see because i didn't want to be a failure and i didn't want to be weak and i believed i could do it so i rammed through life as only a casey can do
CarolineCasey_2010W-0047354-0048030 and that eye specialist he didn't bother testing my eyes god no it was therapy and he asked me several questions of which many were
CarolineCasey_2010W-0060704-0061854 i just simply had no answers i had lost my belief look where my belief had brought me to and now i had lost it and now i really couldn't see i was crumpled and then i remember thinking about that
CarolineCasey_2010W-0087927-0088259 you can make change happen and we need to make it happen
CarolineLavelleFARTHERTHANTHESUN_2005-0007745-0007834 is
CarolinePhillips_2010G-0003267-0004133 so these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy gurdy the hurdy gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel
CarolynPorco_2007-0001277-0001623 in the next eighteen minutes i'm going to take you on a journey and
CarolynPorco_2007-0012322-0013418 just studying the rings alone we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies and here's a beautiful picture of the andromeda nebula which is our closest
CarolynPorco_2007-0026255-0027052 and their products join together to make haze particles this haze is ubiquitous it's completely global and enveloping
CarolynPorco_2007-0038307-0039437 on titan though it is not the same in detail is every bit as fascinating as that story is and for us it has been like for cassini people it has been like a jules verne adventure come true
CarolynPorco_2007-0051352-0052597 in english accents and american accents and german accents and french and italian and dutch accents it was a moving demonstration of what the words united nations is supposed to mean
CarolynPorco_2007-0064941-0065905 and obviously it landed in one of these flat dark regions and it didn't sink out of sight so it wasn't fluid that we landed in what
CarolynPorco_2007-0077387-0078184 is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the earth itself and so now we go onto enceladus
CarolynPorco_2007-0087116-0088215 under the surface of enceladus so we have possibly liquid water organic materials and excess heat in order words we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail
CarolynPorco_2007-0092754-0093150 any of you were alert and coherent during the nineteen sixties
CarolynPorco_2007-0099078-0099951 now there is something deeply moving about seeing ourselves from afar and capturing the sight of our little blue ocean planet in the skies of other worlds and that
CarolynPorco_2009U-0011513-0012226 and we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported
CarolynSteel_2009G-0007167-0008418 were and as more of us move into cities more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me it's soybean fields in mata grosso in brazil in
CarolynSteel_2009G-0018587-0019160 even managing to feed the planet properly a billion of us are obese while a further billion
CarolynSteel_2009G-0032208-0033132 this is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world because it was very difficult to transport food over roads which were rough and the food obviously went off very quickly
CarolynSteel_2009G-0044301-0045159 and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes and then when they hit the eastern end of cheapside
CarolynSteel_2009G-0056904-0058265 from any apparent relationship with nature at all and this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell devoid of mess certainly devoid of people because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape in fact what they did to get food was they got in their cars
CarolynSteel_2009G-0071622-0072953 got a double derivation from the greek it can either mean a good place or no place because it's an ideal it's an imaginary thing we can't have it and i think as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling
CarolynSteel_2009G-0090401-0091357 and i want us to ask now what would ambrogio lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today what would an allegory of good government look like today
CarterEmmart_2010-0011886-0012994 our main space shows in the dome but what you see here is the result of actually internships that we hosted with linkoping university in sweden
CarterEmmart_2010-0019938-0020592 so far up we're finally seeing a containment around us the afterglow of the big bang this is the
CarterEmmart_2010-0032952-0033438 and the cambodians have actually controlled the hayden planetarium from their high school
CaryFowler_2009G-0006049-0006917 what he understood was that biological diversity crop diversity is the biological foundation of agriculture
CaryFowler_2009G-0016821-0017945 but the interesting thing is that this diversity and the tragic thing is that this diversity is being lost we have about two hundred thousand different varieties of wheat
CaryFowler_2009G-0032379-0033005 as grown in new york the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality and is on the whole
CaryFowler_2009G-0045843-0047135 now the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world and the place where climate change ironically is going to be the worst is in south asia and sub sahara africa so i've picked two examples here and i want to show you
CaryFowler_2009G-0053359-0054298 thirty percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population that's a food crises it's global in nature we will watch children starve to death on tv
CaryFowler_2009G-0061732-0062710 actually losing it never to be seen again so a number of us got together and decided that you know enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility
CaryFowler_2009G-0074695-0074893 the happiest days of my life have been spent
CaryFowler_2009G-0088372-0089188 and tell you that we can't solve any of those problems if we don't have crop diversity because i challenge you to think of
CaryFowler_2009G-0099332-0100501 we of course by conserving wheat rice potatoes and the other crops we may quite simply end up saving ourselves thank you
CatarinaMota_2012G-0024113-0025835 so a little over three years ago kirsty boyle and i started a project we called open materials it's a website where we and anyone else who wants to join us share experiments publish information encourage others to contribute whenever they can
CatarinaMota_2012G-0039890-0041501 another example i'd like to mention is hannah perner wilson's kit of no parts her project's goal is to highlight the expressive qualities of materials while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder
CatherineMohr_2009-0004804-0005575 cutting reshaping reforming bypassing fixing but you need to talk about
CatherineMohr_2009-0020418-0021823 this persisted all the way into and through the renaissance that may have saved the writers but it didn't really save the surgeons terribly much they were still a mistrusted lot surgeons still had a bit of a pr problem
CatherineMohr_2009-0037000-0037552 with the patient insensitive to pain and a sterile operating field
CatherineMohr_2009-0046802-0047430 we bring instruments in from two separate cuts in the side and then you can start manipulating tissue
CatherineMohr_2009-0057214-0057996 and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory and the reason why this becomes so much easier is you can see
CatherineMohr_2009-0075630-0076310 and instruments in together through one small tube like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video
CatherineMohr_2009-0087566-0088693 this is a cancer surgery one of the problems with this even for surgeons who've been looking at this a lot is you can't see the cancer especially when it's hidden below the surface
CatherineMohr_2009-0102129-0102931 i've talked about the patient as if the patient is somehow someone abstract outside this room and that is not the case
CatherineMohr_2010U-0001648-0002661 first of all i'm a geek i'm an organic food eating carbon footprint minimizing robotic surgery geek and i really want to build
CatherineMohr_2010U-0012872-0013641 have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize now imagine someone as twisted as me trying to build a house
CatherineMohr_2010U-0018713-0019446 we then dug a big hole to put in a rainwater catchment tank to take our yard water independent and then we poured a big
CatherineMohr_2010U-0024448-0025319 and sprayed in cellulose or blue jeans is a much lower energy alternative to that we also used straw bale in fill for our library
CesarHarada_2012S-0001741-0002674 is the common point between oil plastic and radioactivity
CesarHarada_2012S-0021922-0023682 then i was so happy that i kept playing with the robot and so you see the robot has a front rudder here normally it's at the back and playing i realized that the maneuverability of this was really amazing and i could avoid an obstacle at the very last second more maneuverable than a normal boat
CesarHarada_2012S-0054504-0055378 what we really want is that this innovation happens continuously the inventor and engineers and also the manufacturers and everybody works at the same time
CesarHarada_2012S-0080922-0081701 this is what our teammates we dream of at night we hope that we can sometime clean up oil spills or we can
CesarKuriyama_2012-0012392-0012811 created this thing in my head where i never forgot ever again
CesarKuriyama_2012-0029220-0030868 one of the reasons that i took my year off was to spend more time with my family and this really tragic thing happened where my sister in law her intestine suddenly strangled one day and we took her to the emergency room and she was
ChadeMengTan_2010Z-0002503-0003166 his name is matthieu ricard so how do you get to be the happiest man in the world
ChadeMengTan_2010Z-0013641-0014405 all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun
ChadeMengTan_2010Z-0019359-0019725 google is a company born of idealism
ChadeMengTan_2010Z-0031618-0032326 working on issues such as education poverty health care and the environment
ChadeMengTan_2010Z-0046350-0046761 understanding people and empathizing with people
ChadeMengTan_2010Z-0059907-0060342 if you already have a culture of compassion
ChadeMengTan_2010Z-0073409-0075108 with high clarity objectivity and from a third person perspective and once you can do that you create the kind of self knowledge that enables self mastery the third step following the second step
CharityTillemannDick_2010P-0002409-0003693 one year ago today i woke up from a month long coma following a double lung transplant crazy i
CharityTillemannDick_2010P-0015407-0016199 i come from colorado it's a mile high and i grew up there with my ten brothers and sisters and two adoring parents
CharityTillemannDick_2010P-0027792-0028381 a bubble in your medicine because you have to mix it every morning and it stays in there you probably die
CharityTillemannDick_2010P-0032798-0034044 and the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume designers i graduated from graduate school in two thousand and six and i got a fellowship to go back to europe
CharityTillemannDick_2010P-0039450-0040176 at twenty four my death would have been entirely expected but his
CharityTillemannDick_2010P-0053486-0054278 anywhere farther that a flight for life from johns hopkins hospital i performed here and there but as my condition deteriorated so did my voice
CharityTillemannDick_2010P-0065277-0065957 and everybody was really happy for me but me because despite their problems i
CharityTillemannDick_2010P-0076451-0077796 he said it would kill me so my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last ditch attempt to save my voice though my mom couldn't say goodbye to me before the surgery she didn't leave my side
CharlesAnderson_2009I-0007989-0008973 now when i talk about the northeast monsoon season i'm sure many of you here know exactly what i mean but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure i need to explain a little bit about monsoons
CharlesAnderson_2009I-0023709-0024486 it seems a bit dull you know it's sort of dull colored and it's fairly common and it occurs everywhere you know why bother but
CharlesAnderson_2009I-0042957-0044287 still in southwest monsoon maldives is still in the southwest monsoon but wind is invariably every time is from the west it's going towards india not from india so are these things how are these things getting here are they coming from india against the wind seemed a bit unlikely so
CharlesAnderson_2009I-0058603-0059422 i know how they come here but why do they come here what are millions of dragonflies doing flying out over the ocean every year
CharlesAnderson_2009I-0080768-0081503 which up until now has had the longest known insect migration it's only half the length of this one and this crossing here of the ocean is the
CharlesElachi_2008P-0002165-0003142 they were a bunch of kids they were kind of very imaginative very adventurous as they were trying at caltech to mix chemicals and see which one blows up more well i don't recommend that you try to do that now
CharlesElachi_2008P-0018204-0019068 rose bowl you know when we entered one of the floats that's more on the play side and on the right side that's the rover just before we finished its testing
CharlesElachi_2008P-0034779-0035725 and one of the first or the easiest places we can go and explore that is to go towards mars and the reason mars takes particular attention it's not very far from us
CharlesElachi_2008P-0048942-0049862 and the reason is many of you went to the grand canyon and you see in the wall of the grand canyon you see these layers and what these layers that's what the surface used to be
CharlesElachi_2008P-0060572-0061576 and the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint you know it's not working very well so it's walking like this and we can move the arm you know that way but still they are producing a lot of scientific data
CharlesElachi_2008P-0078388-0078937 and actually heat them and look what gases will come from it so this was launched about nine months ago
CharlesElachi_2008P-0088973-0089225 from this point we're going to decelerate from twelve thousand
CharlesElachi_2008P-0096093-0096436 but that last one percent as it always seems to be is the tricky part eb now
CharlesElachi_2008P-0106292-0107506 so now let me talk about the next things that we are doing so we are in the process as we speak of actually designing the next rover that we are going to be sending to mars so i thought i would go a little bit and tell you kind of the steps we go through it's very similar to what
CharlesElachi_2008P-0119432-0120793 in the lab at jpl in what we call our mars yard we kick them we hit them we drop them just to make sure we understand how where would they break and then we back off you know from that point
CharlesElachi_2008P-0131210-0132031 to actually serve cocktails you know also on mars so that's kind of giving you an idea of the kind of you know fun things we are doing on mars i thought i'd go to the
CharlesElachi_2008P-0141788-0142623 which is rotating and we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form each one looking very different and very odd and that keeps scientists busy for
CharlesElachi_2008P-0158345-0159283 down just looked like the coast of california for me you see the rivers which are coming along the coast and you see that white area which looks like catalina island and that looks like an ocean
CharlesFleischer_2005-0003148-0003326 and when you use these things you don't have to go like that
CharlesFleischer_2005-0013957-0013985 look
CharlesFleischer_2005-0027605-0028235 simple the goddess of goats very simple djabran fluctus now frank is this clear to you djabran fluctus yeah
CharlesFleischer_2005-0042926-0043126 he was also famous for having no body
CharlesFleischer_2005-0054046-0054122 really hurry up
CharlesFleischer_2005-0066097-0066203 as you can see
CharlesFleischer_2005-0081372-0082241 alright where is this going that's a good question here is the premise that i began twenty seven years ago if numbers can express
CharlesFleischer_2005-0095726-0096110 here at ted why because this is the place if aliens land i hope they come here
CharlesHazlewood_2011G-0007540-0008410 for myself of course i have to completely trust my body language that's all i have at the point of sale it's silent gesture
CharlesHazlewood_2011G-0032004-0032249 we sang
CharlesHazlewood_2011G-0072614-0073383 you can't tell me that there aren't millions of disabled people in the u k alone with massive musical potential
CharlesHazlewood_2011G-0091455-0091915 long way away in those days you can imagine the musicians were disconsolate
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G-0007975-0008727 who were frustrated with traditional racing bikes which were those sort of bikes that eddy merckx rode or your big brother and they're very glamorous
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G-0020798-0021808 the traditional view still enshrined in much of the way that we think about creativity in organizations in government is that creativity is about special people
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G-0033945-0035144 so the more radical the innovation the more the uncertainty the more you need innovation in use to work out what a technology is for all of our patents our
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G-0046104-0046936 who in the music industry thirty years ago would have said yes let's invent a musical form which is all about
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G-0059017-0059909 twenty years ago thirty years ago only big professional astronomers with very big telescopes could see far into space
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G-0070432-0071456 meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge they are increasingly being used by large companies to create thickets of patents to prevent innovation taking place
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G-0085695-0086522 and these i think are two challenges for the open movement the first is can we really survive on volunteers
CharlesLeadbeater_2005G-0099176-0100093 he gives them a platform he gives them some rules he gives them the tools and then he kind of orchestrates the conversation he orchestrates the action
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S-0002250-0002355 is the home of the
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S-0014149-0015015 and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work traditional high cost solutions which depend on professionals which is what schools and hospitals are
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S-0030398-0031579 so the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the kings and queens of kenya or britain they are to stay alive to earn a living to not become hiv positive
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S-0043947-0045058 well education is a global religion and education plus technology is a great source of hope you can go to places like this this is a school three hours outside
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S-0058763-0060035 you have to engage people first before you can possibly teach them our education systems you do all that stuff afterward if you're lucky sport drama music these things they teach through
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S-0070384-0071261 something you make something you can do perhaps earn a living from so i met this character steven he'd spent three years
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S-0083928-0084831 so mass education started with social entrepreneurship in the nineteenth century and that's desperately what we need again on a global scale
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S-0097897-0098647 learning that starts from questions and problems and projects not from knowledge and curriculum so we certainly need more of
CharlesLeadbeater_2010S-0104058-0104994 which need radicalism of a kind that we haven't imagined and finally you need transformational innovation that could imagine getting learning to people in completely new and different
CharlesLimb_2010X-0001625-0002388 so i am a surgeon who studies creativity and i have never had a patient tell me that i really want you to be creative during surgery
CharlesLimb_2010X-0025591-0026712 the way that's done is by the following there's something called bold imaging which is blood oxygen level imaging now when you're in an fmri scanner you're in a big magnet that's aligning your molecules in certain areas
CharlesLimb_2010X-0050569-0051350 do a whole host of things that have to do with self reflection introspection working memory and so forth really consciousness is seated in the frontal lobe
CharlesLimb_2010X-0068093-0068927 this is in fact mike pope's data so what am i showing you here when he was trading fours with me improvising versus memorized his language areas
CharlesLimb_2011P-0001581-0002091 when we think of our senses
CharlesLimb_2011P-0015613-0016991 in fact nothing even actually comes close to our ability to restore hearing and as a physician and a surgeon i can confidently tell my patients that if you had to pick a sense to lose we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing as a musician
CharlesLimb_2011P-0041335-0042137 so if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music transmission
CharlesLimb_2011P-0075055-0076007 if we were to direct efforts towards training cochlear implant users to hear music because right now there's virtually no effort put towards that no rehabilitative strategies
CharlesLimb_2011P-0091723-0093576 and we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing and let me tell you right now it's fine that we would all be very happy with speech but i tell you if we lost our hearing if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing you would want perfect hearing back you wouldn't want decent hearing you would want perfect hearing
CharlesMoore_2009U-0009254-0010322 to the sea here is the accumulation at biona creek next to the airport and here is the flotsam near california state university long beach and the de sal plant we visited yesterday
CharlesMoore_2009U-0021930-0022932 the retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals this is mae west still alive at a zookeeper's home in new orleans
CharlesMoore_2009U-0033582-0034498 and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs the record holder only two and a half inches long had eighty four pieces in its tiny stomach
CharlieTodd_2011X-0023150-0024435 day inspired me to keep doing what i do and really one of the points of improv everywhere is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people it's a prank but it's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell
CharlieTodd_2011X-0052315-0052684 like that concept of using their own technology against them
CharmianGooch_2013G-0015319-0017156 so it's easy to think that corruption happens somewhere over there carried out by a bunch of greedy despots and individuals up to no good in countries that we personally may know very little about and feel really unconnected to and unaffected by what might be going on
CharmianGooch_2013G-0040617-0042272 but they prioritize their profits in other destructive ways too for example in sarawak malaysia now this region it has just five percent of its forests left intact five percent
CharmianGooch_2013G-0065263-0066748 well because there's a lot at stake in two thousand and eleven natural resource exports outweighed aid flows by almost nineteen to one in africa asia and latin america nineteen to one
CharmianGooch_2013G-0075333-0076401 but in some countries citizens and journalists who are trying to expose stories like this have been harassed and arrested and some have even risked their lives to do so
CherylHayashi_2010-0002639-0003422 this red dot marks the great basin of north america and i'm involved with an alpine biodiversity project there with some collaborators
CherylHayashi_2010-0015401-0016755 there are many kinds of spider silk for example this garden spider can make seven different kinds of silks when you look at this orb web you're actually seeing many types of silk fibers the frame and radii of this web
CherylHayashi_2010-0033614-0034027 the large variety of flavors of spider silks that we have today
CherylHayashi_2010-0052397-0053917 specifically if you look on the vertical axis that's stress if you look at the maximum stress value for each of these fibers you can see that there's a lot of variation and in fact dragline or major ampullate silk is the strongest of these fibers
CherylHayashi_2010-0072440-0073084 but it's unexpected results like this that make bio prospecting so exciting and worthwhile
CherylHayashi_2010-0081618-0081842 fascinating in and of itself
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G-0003311-0003604 although i think four is probably close to the truth
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G-0013476-0014568 many of them available and they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books but because of writers like chinua achebe and camara laye i went through a mental shift in my perception of literature
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G-0022257-0022451 so i felt enormous pity
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G-0031189-0032314 in this single story there was no possibility of africans being similar to her in any way no possibility of feelings more complex than pity no possibility of a connection as human
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G-0045564-0046954 and so i began to realize that my american roommate must have throughout her life seen and heard different versions of this single story as had a professor who once told me that my novel was not authentically
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G-0056414-0056852 i had bought into the single story of mexicans and i could not have been more ashamed of myself
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G-0064342-0065400 start the story with the failure of the african state and not with the colonial creation of the african state and you have an entirely different story
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G-0076239-0077340 and so as a child i saw jam disappear from the breakfast table then margarine disappeared then bread became too expensive then milk became rationed
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G-0087724-0089074 what if my roommate knew about my nigerian publisher mukta bakaray a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house now the conventional wisdom was that nigerians don't read literature
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G-0099577-0100928 what if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider who has just started her own business selling hair extensions or about the millions of other nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail but continue to nurse ambition
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G-0106166-0106997 many stories matter stories have been used to dispossess and to malign but stories can also be used to empower
ChimamandaAdichie_2009G-0110394-0110822 that when we reject the single story when we realize that there is never
ChipConley_2010-0020605-0021875 as i sat there for four hours the full afternoon reading maslow i actually recognized something that is true of most leaders and one of the simplest facts in business is something that we often neglect
ChipConley_2010-0036917-0037868 so i actually went out and studied a bunch of things and i found a survey that showed that ninety four percent of business leaders worldwide believe that the intangibles are important in their business
ChipConley_2010-0049994-0050186 but the king was serious and this was a
ChipConley_2010-0066597-0067738 how many of us here as tedsters in the audience spend more of our time in the bottom half of this equation in the denominator we are a bottom heavy culture in more ways than one
ChipConley_2010-0087118-0087271 we've been fooled by our tool
ChipConley_2010-0102166-0102880 to truly take into account our people i learned that from a maid in a motel and a king of a country
ChipKidd_2012-0013103-0014035 and i was incredibly lucky soon it had occurred to me what my job was my job was to ask this question
ChipKidd_2012-0030460-0031642 i went to the museum of natural history and i checked out the bones and i went to the gift shop and i bought a book and i was particularly taken with this page of the book
ChipKidd_2012-0046659-0047292 no that is not me
ChipKidd_2012-0065798-0066149 and the guy behind the counter said i know lady they all came in that way
ChipKidd_2012-0079738-0080949 tradition a sensual experience the comfort of thingy ness a little bit of humanity do you know what john
ChipKidd_2012-0097595-0098835 so that's my story to be continued what does it look like yes it can it does and it will
ChrisAbani_2007G-0009199-0010032 chimpanzees and i thought wow what if a chimpanzee could talk you know what would it say my first thought was well you know there's george bush
ChrisAbani_2007G-0025359-0026132 shiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body giraffes are this desire in the
ChrisAbani_2007G-0040202-0040567 a nigerian joke well it's just a joke anyway
ChrisAbani_2007G-0046011-0047059 my father was educated in cork in the university of cork in the fifties in fact every time i read in ireland people get me all mistaken and they say oh this is chris o'barney from cork
ChrisAbani_2007G-0052542-0053813 so huddled around books with photographs of people in auschwitz i learned the melancholic history of my people through the melancholic history of another people i mean picture this really picture this a
ChrisAbani_2007G-0065511-0066271 all of those are gone we are squandering the most valuable resource we have on this continent the valuable resource of the imagination
ChrisAbani_2007G-0078185-0079482 of wounds and self loathing and this is the difficulty that i face i am trying to move beyond political rhetoric to a place of ethical questioning i am asking us to balance the idea of our complete vulnerability
ChrisAbani_2007G-0091828-0092718 the fact that it happens in another country takes you quite by surprise my friend ronald gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world those who can count and those
ChrisAbani_2007G-0102893-0103042 now i have beaten
ChrisAbani_2008-0011599-0012201 what ubuntu really says is that there is no way for us to be human without other people
ChrisAbani_2008-0019390-0019502 so this woman
ChrisAbani_2008-0026018-0026056 and
ChrisAbani_2008-0037088-0037816 and they would sing these dirges made up of these names dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you
ChrisAbani_2008-0044505-0044615 never really counted
ChrisAbani_2008-0052853-0053015 my friend brad kessler says
ChrisAbani_2008-0060298-0060924 so growing up you know i had a cake and everything but i never got any presents because born two days after christmas
ChrisAbani_2008-0071828-0072377 and he had smuggled in two comics two comic books spiderman and x men he was obsessed
ChrisAbani_2008-0082384-0082528 they would knock down the shrine
ChrisAbani_2008-0087116-0087281 the poem is called libation
ChrisAbani_2008-0091857-0091987 beautiful daughter
ChrisAnderson_2002-0001628-0002707 this is your conference and i think you have a right to know a little bit right now in this transition period about this guy who's going to be looking after it for you for
ChrisAnderson_2002-0009325-0010148 and i was the forty percent owner of a dot com that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more
ChrisAnderson_2002-0022046-0023185 and i think what disgusts me more than anything looking back is how the hell did i let my personal happiness get so tied up with this business thing
ChrisAnderson_2002-0034158-0035321 of this just one example madame de gaulle the wife of the french president was famously asked once what do you most desire and she
ChrisAnderson_2002-0048972-0050188 that i've discovered other than ted where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions and so it's the profound thing that richard talks about to understand
ChrisAnderson_2002-0064336-0064952 do want to if i can find a way of extending the ted experience throughout the year
ChrisAnderson_2004-0001273-0001734 i'd like to speak about technology trends which is something that
ChrisAnderson_2004-0015915-0016677 i'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that i call my grand unified theory of predicting the future but it's
ChrisAnderson_2004-0029064-0029261 the next thing it hit a year later
ChrisAnderson_2004-0046952-0047142 you know our ability to
ChrisAnderson_2004-0062929-0064173 you can change the structure of the car in any way you want you can have regenerative braking you can have drive by wire you can have replaceable body shapes it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid but it can lead to a whole new era of the car
ChrisAnderson_2004-0075010-0076009 and you've seen the numbers i mean you know the music industry is imploding in front of our very eyes and hollywood's worried as well they're facing a force
ChrisAnderson_2010G-0004628-0005392 i've become intrigued by a different way of thinking of large human crowds because there are circumstances where they can do something really cool
ChrisAnderson_2010G-0015104-0016362 seems strangely familiar you know a while after tedtalks started taking off we noticed that speakers were starting to spend a lot more time in preparation it was resulting in incredible new talks like these two
ChrisAnderson_2010G-0027742-0028452 and amazingly you can still see what the best can do because the crowd itself shines a light on them
ChrisAnderson_2010G-0042307-0043144 because it works for us each time we opened up our talks to the world and suddenly there are millions of people out there helping spread our speakers ideas
ChrisAnderson_2010G-0054995-0055720 few years of the web were pretty much video free for this reason video files are huge the web couldn't handle them but in the last ten years
ChrisAnderson_2010G-0062404-0063171 and i have to tell you as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines i find this strangely beautiful i mean there's a lot of passion right here on this screen
ChrisAnderson_2010G-0070468-0071609 well so there's some showing as well as telling but even leaving the screen out of it there's still a lot more being transferred than just words and in that non verbal portion there's some serious magic
ChrisAnderson_2010G-0089230-0090018 and to help shine a light on the very best of what's out there because if we can bubble up the very best from a vastly larger pool this wheel
ChrisAnderson_2010G-0102596-0103310 into a garden the same spot it was a crime spot where people were being robbed they used the same trash to form
ChrisBangle_2002-0003583-0004047 to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art
ChrisBangle_2002-0013631-0014771 by hand many people think well it's computers and it's done by machines and stuff like that well they reproduce it but the originals are all done by hand it's done by men and women who believe a lot
ChrisBangle_2002-0026689-0027691 it's beauty and love now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers we don't really have a problem talking about love we don't have a problem talking about truth or
ChrisBangle_2002-0036575-0037795 works you know you can understand that it works in truisms all is fair in design and war certainly we live in a competitive society i think this one here there's a pop song that really describes philippe starck for me
ChrisBangle_2002-0047605-0048200 the intimacy with which we work together as a team takes on a new dimension a new meaning
ChrisBangle_2002-0062048-0062772 so sent the team off and actually something different happened they went other places
ChrisBangle_2002-0074128-0075437 modern consumer and one was hoping that these two teams would get together and this collusion of incredible creativity under these incredible surroundings and these incredibly stressed out engineers would create some incredible solutions
ChrisBangle_2002-0087963-0088674 we spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers
ChrisBangle_2002-0101602-0102978 and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife and i recalled that when catherine and i were married the priest gave a very nice sermon and he said something very important he said love is not selfish
ChrisBangle_2002-0111156-0111853 and i think we felt much closer that day we cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there and we forged the concept for
ChrisBliss_2011X-0005517-0006623 now i was a comparative literature major in college which is like an english major only instead of being stuck studying chaucer for three months we got to read great literature in translation from around the world
ChrisBliss_2011X-0021188-0022185 ever communicate well with other people the ideas that i was gaining i'd better find a different way of going about it and that's when i discovered comedy
ChrisBliss_2011X-0033694-0034702 and the key detail of this is that fey's scripts weren't written by her and they weren't written by the snl writers they were lifted verbatim from palin's own remarks
ChrisBliss_2011X-0045350-0046560 and the result is great comedy that's also an information delivery system that scores markedly higher in both credibility and retention than the professional news media
ChrisBliss_2011X-0051874-0052971 only by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin we get endorphins and the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows revealing a fresh and unexpected point of view
ChrisBliss_2011X-0070287-0070671 first there were drums and then knock knock jokes
ChrisBliss_2011X-0084524-0084905 so we tossed it back and forth until joel came up with this
ChrisGerdes_2012X-0008434-0009275 now california's considering similar legislation and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in vegas
ChrisGerdes_2012X-0018916-0019336 is what we believe is the world's first autonomously drifting car
ChrisGerdes_2012X-0028158-0028343 are amazing
ChrisGerdes_2012X-0034547-0034703 it really makes you think
ChrisGerdes_2012X-0043052-0043591 now we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the track so we headed down south to laguna seca
ChrisJordan_2008-0014349-0015447 speaking of justice there's another phenomenon going on in our culture that i find deeply troubling and that is that america right now has the largest percentage of its population in prison of any country on earth
ChrisJordan_2008-0029213-0030010 and this is what the next piece is about this is just lots and lots of cigarettes sixty five thousand cigarettes which is equal to the number of teenagers
ChrisJordan_2008-0039160-0039476 so i made this image out of barbie dolls
ChrisJordan_2008-0050655-0051203 bush's new budget is in the trillions and these are numbers that our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend
ChrisJordan_2008-0058103-0058242 to look at these issues
ChrisJordan_2008-0065327-0065554 this is who we are in this room
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G-0010541-0011194 well basically it's a product catalog of this one pig and it carries a duplicate of his ear tag on the back
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G-0023574-0024465 used in paint for the texture but also for the glossiness in sandpaper bone glue is actually the glue between the sand and the paper
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G-0030070-0031308 so with the steak you might drink a beer in the brewing process there's lots of cloudy elements in the beer so to get rid of these cloudy elements what some companies do is they pour the beer through a kind of gelatin sieve in order to get rid of
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G-0036203-0037083 because i wanted them to send me the real samples and the real specimens so i sent this company an email saying hello i'm christien i'm doing this research and
ChristienMeindertsma_2010G-0047933-0048591 i found one hundred and eighty five products and what they showed me is that well firstly
ChristinaWarinner_2012U-0010312-0011738 but there are a lot of challenges for this and first of all what do we even study skeletons are ubiquitous they're found all over the place but of course all of the soft tissue has decomposed and the skeleton itself has limited health information
ChristinaWarinner_2012U-0025363-0026623 and we also found bacteria that normally inhabit the gut and so we can also now virtually gain access to this even more distant organ system that from the skeleton alone has long decomposed
ChristophAdami_2011X-0016469-0017138 so it's actually life but it's actually not as we thought life would be
ChristophAdami_2011X-0034735-0035718 not as far as i'm concerned why because these things don't evolve by themselves in fact they have hackers writing them but the idea was taken very quickly a little bit further
ChristophAdami_2011X-0049518-0049849 and this type of activity goes on for quite awhile until
ChristophAdami_2011X-0061529-0062454 and i'm telling you this is very robust across english texts and if i look at french texts it looks a little bit different or italian or german they all have their own type of
ChristophAdami_2011X-0071488-0071858 like earth where there are amino acids but there is no life
ChristophAdami_2011X-0087213-0088900 a replicating program that would otherwise happily grow up to fill the entire world if you drop it in it gets mutated to death immediately so there is no life possible at that type of mutation rate but then i'm going to slowly
ChristophAdami_2011X-0102520-0104008 like all of our scientific discoveries or many of them it's this continuous dethroning of man of how we think we're special because we're alive well we can make life we can make life in the computer granted it's limited but we have learned
ChristopherDeam_2002-0006032-0007219 showed up at my shop in berkeley i'd actually never stepped foot in an airstream trailer or any other trailer so i can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if i can optimize it
ChristopherDeam_2002-0020265-0021554 of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell what i came up with was a series of second skins that basically float
ChristopherDeam_2002-0034008-0035105 the problem became and they set this dilemma to me that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology and there's no money for tooling or molding
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X-0011900-0012378 ruins the script instead of taking off she falls back and she grabs paula radcliffe says come on
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X-0027306-0028736 well there are teams of scientists at harvard and the university of utah that are bending their brains to try to figure out what the tarahumara have known forever they're trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries and once again a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X-0034594-0034907 that would be an olympic event turn a squirrel loose whoever catches the squirrel you get a gold medal
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X-0047723-0048577 if you start running the marathon at age nineteen you will get progressively faster year by year until you reach your peak at age twenty seven and then after that you succumb to the
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X-0059416-0060329 we're superb we're the best on the planet you take a horse on a hot day and after five or six miles that horse has a choice it's either going to breathe or it's going to cool off
ChristopherMcDougall_2010X-0081567-0082523 able to do something extraordinary every day which was just rely on their naked feet and legs to run long distances so how do we get back to that again well i would submit to you the first thing is
ChristopherPoole_2010-0007614-0008412 what it looks like so what's unique about the site is that it's anonymous and it has no memory there's no archive
ChristopherPoole_2010-0021799-0023113 the time one hundred poll so somebody at time at the magazine thought it would be fun to nominate me for this thing they did last year and so they placed me on it and the internet got wind of it my community
ChristopherPoole_2010-0033025-0033462 is the name that we've given to this cat this young man
ChristopherPoole_2010-0049480-0050767 words saying things you know can be constructive it can be really damaging and if you cut the link between what is said and any attribution back to you i mean surely there are huge risks with that
ChristopherPoole_2010-0059595-0060463 it's got some very obscene content on it just in terms of language alone and when you've got that you've pretty much sacrificed any hope of making lots of money
ChristopherdeCharms_2008-0004232-0004819 for thousands of years well coming out of the research labs just now for our generation is the possibility to do that
ChristopherdeCharms_2008-0011240-0012113 he can learn how to control it there have been three ways to try to impact the brain the therapist's couch pills and the knife
ChristopherdeCharms_2008-0022151-0022956 but i want to leave with you the big question we are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into using this technology the human mind and brain
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G-0015366-0016423 and i probably don't need to tell you that we haven't seen anything similar happen to the middle class whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G-0027695-0029467 even after the most profound financial crisis since the great depression or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies including those whose motto might be don't do evil to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that paid by the middle class
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G-0045302-0045784 or european born american fashion designer diane von furstenberg
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G-0064066-0064764 that's why they are spending unprecedented time and resources educating their own children
ChrystiaFreeland_2013G-0075512-0077007 that's shown in what i consider to be the most scary economic statistic of our time since the late one thousand nine hundred and ninety s increases in productivity have been decoupled from increases in wages and employment
ClaronMcFadden_2010X-0015463-0017364 her celebrated operatic roles are numerous and varied in august two thousand and seven claron was awarded the amsterdam prize for the arts winning praise for her brilliance her amazing and extensively wide repertoire and her vivid stage personality please welcome claron mcfadden
ClaronMcFadden_2010X-0023395-0025165 a few years ago i did a meditation retreat in thailand i wanted a place that i would have total silence and total solitude i spent two weeks at this retreat in my own little hut no music no nothing sounds of nature
ClaronMcFadden_2010X-0034546-0035691 when you're totally in the moment when i'm totally in the moment the vessel of expression is open the emotions can flow from me to you and back
ClaronMcFadden_2010X-0048504-0048751 no
ClayShirky_2005G-0013057-0013804 and the answer is i got them from flickr flickr is a photo sharing service that allows people to take photos upload them share them over the web
ClayShirky_2005G-0026070-0027188 and fourth as a result of that exclusion you end up with a professional class look at the change here we've gone from people with photos to photographers right we've created a professional class
ClayShirky_2005G-0039289-0040350 it's mathematically true but it doesn't really talk about anything important because in these systems the average isn't really what matters what matters is this
ClayShirky_2005G-0053479-0054295 is actually here way to the left and that sounds strange to our ears but what ends up happening is that eighty percent of the contributors
ClayShirky_2005G-0064929-0065720 the question is do you want that photo yes or no the question is not is psycho milt a good employee
ClayShirky_2005G-0080635-0081043 the psycho milt question is was it a good idea
ClayShirky_2005G-0093060-0094214 in the united states right now a woman named judith miller is in jail for not having given to a federal grand jury her sources she's a reporter for the new york times her sources in a very abstract and hard to follow case
ClayShirky_2005G-0105400-0106456 these red bracelets which signify in the small group i am trying to maintain my eating disorder they trade tips like if you feel like eating something clean a toilet or the litter box the feeling will pass
ClayShirky_2005G-0118448-0119249 fifty fifty years in which loosely coordinated groups are going to be given increasingly high leverage
ClayShirky_2009S-0007488-0008373 technical capital it's social capital these tools don't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring
ClayShirky_2009S-0025135-0026074 the second big change is that as all media gets digitized the internet also becomes the mode of carriage for all other media
ClayShirky_2009S-0040674-0041762 now they might have liked to have done that here rather than seeing these pictures go up online but they weren't given that choice because their own citizens beat them to the punch
ClayShirky_2009S-0053680-0054708 china is probably the most successful manager of internet censorship in the world using something that is widely described as the great firewall of china
ClayShirky_2009S-0066179-0067002 national message targeted individuals relatively sparse number of producers very expensive to do so there is not a lot of competition this is how you
ClayShirky_2009S-0075777-0076896 and one of the things obama did was they famously the obama campaign did was they famously put up my barak obama dot com mybo com and millions of citizens rushed in to participate and to try and figure out how to help
ClayShirky_2009S-0083787-0084479 thing happened in the conversation people in that group realized that obama had never shut them
ClayShirky_2010S-0003278-0004253 who began blogging about it on her site kenyan pundit and shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence the government suddenly imposed a significant media
ClayShirky_2010S-0014041-0014732 it's been deployed in washington d c to track snow cleanup and it's been used most famously in haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake
ClayShirky_2010S-0025689-0026129 and it's those two things together ancient human motivation
ClayShirky_2010S-0038823-0039125 it is one of the curiosities of our historical era
ClayShirky_2010S-0052923-0053949 and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern that the parents owed the teachers and so the parents quite sensibly said ten shekels to pick my kid up late what could
ClayShirky_2010S-0063978-0064600 lolcats is communal value it's value created by the participants for each other
ClayShirky_2010S-0072852-0073370 and we can see that organizations designed around a culture of generosity
ClayShirky_2012G-0015888-0017440 even the printing press even the printing press was assumed to be a tool that was going to enforce catholic intellectual hegemony across europe instead what we got was martin luther's ninety five theses the protestant reformation and you know the thirty years war
ClayShirky_2012G-0034303-0035721 but computers are such famously inflexible interpreters of instructions that it's extraordinarily difficult to write out a set of instructions that the computer knows how to execute and that's if one person is writing
ClayShirky_2012G-0047135-0048280 but of course this creates the very threat of chaos you have to forestall in order to get anything working so most open source projects just held their noses and adopted the feudal management systems
ClayShirky_2012G-0067419-0067963 i tell you all of this because of what i think it means for the way communities come together
ClayShirky_2012G-0091189-0091526 and it includes this very evocative screenshot
ClayShirky_2012S-0001800-0002442 this is a hand lettered sign that appeared in a mom and pop bakery in my old neighborhood in brooklyn a few years ago
ClayShirky_2012S-0026799-0027213 we do like to consume but every time one of these new tools came

CliffordStoll_2006-0003207-0004162 but i suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non gray atmospheres and polarization of light in jupiter's upper atmosphere are the number of people who'd fit in a bus shelter so
CliffordStoll_2006-0010011-0010520 second book nor am i going to talk about why i believe computers don't belong in schools
CliffordStoll_2006-0018143-0018345 don't ask somebody who's writing code
CliffordStoll_2006-0024607-0025339 i want to talk about what i'm doing now what am i doing now oh the other thing that i think i'd like to talk about is right over here right over here
CliffordStoll_2006-0036308-0036571 the cool one that was a month of my life
CliffordStoll_2006-0044298-0044612 the inventor of the moog synthesizer who passed away this past august
CliffordStoll_2006-0053973-0054090 this place over here right
CliffordStoll_2006-0071434-0072097 of any wave is a constant when the frequency goes up the wavelength comes down wavelength goes up frequency goes down
CliffordStoll_2006-0081873-0082808 the distance from here one full wave over to here from here to here is the wavelength of sound so i'll put a
CliffordStoll_2006-0090289-0090523 go back to this picture of me a million years ago
CliffordStoll_2006-0101490-0102134 when they cast bells they write inscriptions on them so i wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells and i look at it
ColinCamerer_2013X-0008192-0008630 okay here's two theories about how people might think about this and then we'll see some data
ColinCamerer_2013X-0021695-0021873 because they're picking zero or one
ColinCamerer_2013X-0036384-0037780 doesn't know but they know that the informed player knows so the uninformed player's challenge is to say is this guy really being fair or are they giving me a very low offer in order to get me to think that there's only one or two dollars available to split in which case they might reject it and not come to a deal
ColinCamerer_2013X-0049393-0051090 and the direction of the arrows flows from the region that's active first in time and the arrowhead goes to the region that's active later so in this case if you look carefully most of the arrows flow from right to left that is it looks as if the uninformed brain activity is happening first
ColinCamerer_2013X-0057400-0058096 million years ago they're still our closest genetic kin we share ninety eight point eight percent of the genes we share more genes with them than zebras do with horses
ColinCamerer_2013X-0065868-0067630 is based on an idea of tetsuro matsuzawa he had a bold idea that what he called the cognitive trade off hypothesis we know chimps are faster and stronger they're also very obsessed with status his thought was maybe they've preserved brain activities and they practice them in development that are really really important to them to negotiate status and to win
ColinCamerer_2013X-0078444-0079685 they're closer to fifty fifty they're not responding to payoffs as closely and also if you study their learning in the game they aren't as sensitive to previous rewards the chimps are playing better than the humans better in the sense of adhering to game theory and these are two different groups of humans from japan
ColinPowell_2012X-0010165-0010828 and the trick i play in all of my school appearances is that when i get through with my little homily to the kids
ColinPowell_2012X-0028552-0028739 they are mature
ColinPowell_2012X-0040240-0040982 and i watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they're much to the distress of my children they are
ColinPowell_2012X-0052063-0054014 and i finally bounced through high school got into the city college of new york with a seventy eight point three average which i shouldn't have been allowed in with and then i started out in engineering and that only lasted six months laughter and then i went into geology rocks for jocks this is easy and then i found rotc
ColinPowell_2012X-0067186-0067432 because they're not getting the gift of a good start
ColinPowell_2012X-0073447-0075075 sometimes i would get in trouble and my parents were coming home and i was in my room waiting for what's going to happen and i would sit there saying to myself okay look take the belt and hit me but god don't give me that shame the family bit again it devastated me when my mother did that to me
ColinPowell_2012X-0079876-0080245 as long as you got an education and then you got a job
ColinPowell_2012X-0087061-0087349 those that we call minorities now are going to be the majority
ColinPowell_2012X-0098108-0098558 i've got no bodyguards i've got no police cars i've got nothing but i gotta have my hot dog
ColinStokes_2012X-0001789-0003182 i love sharing my favorite movies with my kids and when my daughter was four we got to watch the wizard of oz together it totally dominated her imagination for months her favorite character was glinda of course
ColinStokes_2012X-0015128-0016468 and i don't think he understands what's going on but he is sure soaking in it and i wonder what he's soaking in is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty
ColinStokes_2012X-0031867-0032491 and as three dimensional and delightful as hermione and katniss are these are still war movies
ColinStokes_2012X-0049186-0050407 eleven it's not bad it's not as many percent as the number of women we've just elected to congress so that's good but there is a number that is greater than this
ColinStokes_2012X-0059424-0060691 and we hope that that will help but i gotta wonder is girl power going to protect them if at the same time actively or passively we are training our sons to maintain their boy power
ColinStokes_2012X-0070581-0070932 maybe it's not just the sparkly dress i think these people
ColinStokes_2012X-0073943-0074535 maybe a team led by women to help other people
ConradWolfram_2010G-0005647-0006718 so what's the problem why has this chasm opened up and what can we do to fix it well actually i think the answer is staring us right in the face use computers
ConradWolfram_2010G-0021371-0022407 and this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world beyond virtually any other part of doing math people ask the wrong question and surprisingly enough they get the wrong answer for that reason if not for others
ConradWolfram_2010G-0036694-0037552 i think we should be assuming computers for doing the calculating and only doing hand calculation where it really makes sense to teach people that and i think there are some cases
ConradWolfram_2010G-0054360-0055276 so i asked her one day you know when i was your age i didn't make these why do you think that was and after a second or two carefully reflecting she said no paper
ConradWolfram_2010G-0072903-0074067 so programming is the way i think we should be doing that so to be clear what i really am suggesting here is we have a unique opportunity to make maths both more practical and more conceptual simultaneously
ConradWolfram_2010G-0090226-0091228 and is critical for people's real understanding so i believe critical reform we have to do in computer based math we have to make sure
CorneilleEwango_2007G-0004523-0005383 i grew in my uncle's house and my father was a soldier and my uncle was a fisherman and
CorneilleEwango_2007G-0017142-0018420 so the okapi faunal reserve protects number i think that is the largest number of elephant we have right now in protected area in congo it has also chimpanzees and it
CorneilleEwango_2007G-0031325-0032345 every person was looking his way where to go we don't know and it was for us young the first time really we hear the language of
CorneilleEwango_2007G-0044039-0044852 and what i did i gave him just antibiotics that we care for that tuberculosis and fortunately
CorneilleEwango_2007G-0055978-0056654 when it started i think so it was so bad we heard that now from the east again
CorneilleEwango_2007G-0069638-0070416 that i hide it in the forest and every time daily after we have meeting what
CorneilleEwango_2007G-0083141-0083811 report and then i see the chief commander and i succeeded the elephant just decayed and
CorneilleEwango_2007G-0095670-0096008 is it a game i think we
CornielleEwango_2007G-0009247-0009523 i believed to continue my studies
CornielleEwango_2007G-0026332-0027480 was completely difficult to do and to achieve it when kabila started his movement to liberate congo so mobutu soldiers
CornielleEwango_2007G-0032194-0032780 the first time really we hear the language of war of guns
CornielleEwango_2007G-0049663-0051621 i have to save something even myself my life and life of the staff i buried some of our new vehicle engines i buried it to save it and some of equipment went with them on the top of the canopy to save it he's not collecting plants he's going to save our equipment on the canopy
CornielleEwango_2007G-0089229-0090914 my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity and what the impacts of the ituri forest is playing to uptake carbon this is one of the studies we are doing on a forty hectare plot where we have tagged
CourtneyMartin_2010W-0011124-0012256 my dad actually resigned from the male only business club in my hometown because he said he would never be part of an organization that would one day welcome his son but not his daughter
CourtneyMartin_2010W-0038173-0040130 and there's a lot to be overwhelmed about to be fair an environmental crisis wealth disparity in this country unlike we've seen since one thousand nine hundred and twenty eight and globally a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity xenophobia's on the rise the trafficking of women and girls it's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed
CourtneyMartin_2010W-0060752-0062691 she was talking about board meetings she was founding peace organizations she was coordinating carpools she was consoling friends all these daily acts of care and creativity and surely at three and four years old i was listening to the soothing sound of her voice but i think i was also getting my first lesson in activist work
CraigVenter_2005G-0014949-0015644 where we were as with great oceanographic expeditions trying to sample the ocean every two hundred miles
CraigVenter_2005G-0028495-0029389 based on temperatures red being warm blue being cold and we found there's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold
CraigVenter_2005G-0041982-0042701 synthetic dna the ability to synthesize dna has changed at sort of the same pace that dna sequencing has over
CraigVenter_2005G-0059269-0060016 this is a case where the software now builds its own hardware and that's the notions that we have with biology
CraigVenter_2005G-0072079-0072957 this is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation the glass started to burn and crack while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier
CraigVenter_2005G-0083636-0084353 within a short while i think there's going to be a new field called combinatorial genomics because with these new synthesis capabilities
CraigVenter_2005G-0097471-0098432 should be using in this area and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward these are complex issues except for the threat of bio terrorism
CraigVenter_2010P-0010053-0010625 it's been a fifteen year quest just to get to the starting point now to be able to answer those questions
CraigVenter_2010P-0022443-0023134 dna phage dna virus dna genome that was actually sequenced so
CraigVenter_2010P-0035561-0036382 and we knew once that worked that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those
CraigVenter_2010P-0047959-0048392 it turns out the dna in the bacterial cell was actually methylated
CraigVenter_2010P-0052678-0054050 because of the problems with mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth about a year and a half ago we decided to synthesize the much larger chromosome the mycoides chromosome
CraigVenter_2010P-0059574-0060310 so accuracy is essential there's parts of the genome where it cannot tolerate even a single error
CraigVenter_2010P-0070557-0071655 so the team actually developed a new code within the code within the code so it's a new code for interpreting and writing messages in dna
CraigVenter_2010P-0082526-0083126 to fall to triumph and to recreate life out of life it's a james joyce quote
CraigVenter_2010P-0095905-0096942 but we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we're already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W-0002059-0002410 i've been fascinated by this idea of personal robots
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W-0013233-0013441 and one of my favorite robots
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W-0028238-0028523 but with the robot you can and so in this video here
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W-0044013-0044781 so i love the idea of thinking about robots as a new kind of distance play technology i imagine a time not too far from now
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W-0061636-0062052 so the first thing i want to look at is how long how long did people interact with these systems
CynthiaBreazeal_2010W-0071164-0071428 what if
CynthiaKenyon_2011G-0005703-0006928 an aging gene maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan and if you could do that then you could find the genes for aging and if they exist and you can find them then maybe one could eventually do something about it
CynthiaKenyon_2011G-0014547-0015040 now get out your handkerchiefs here you're going to see in just two weeks the normal worms are old
CynthiaKenyon_2011G-0041223-0041972 so it's really interesting and it makes sense in a way that they're still young so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old
CynthiaKenyon_2011G-0057097-0058324 so it activates foxo foxo goes to the dna and that triggers the expression of these genes that improves the ability of the cell to protect itself and repair itself and that's why we think the animals live longer
CynthiaKenyon_2011G-0081795-0083342 change the genes in principle there isn't the technology to do that but i don't think that's a good idea and the reason is that these hormones like the insulin and the igf hormones and the tor pathway they're essential if you knock them out completely
CynthiaSchneider_2009G-0005085-0005778 form and lima sahar was a finalist in the afghan star singing competition
CynthiaSchneider_2009G-0013809-0015151 because also part of this is campaigning people become so engaged that they have volunteers just like political volunteers anyway who fan out over the countryside
CynthiaSchneider_2009G-0022756-0023627 and she's out there her poetry is about women and the life of women in society so just by
DaleDougherty_2011S-0006919-0008542 and the question he had is can i do it can it be done apparently it can so makers are enthusiasts they're amateurs they're people who love doing what they do they don't always even know why they're doing it
DaleDougherty_2011S-0031313-0032047 we gather we form and we fashion makers and shapers and put it togetherers
DaleDougherty_2011S-0046912-0047461 and probably to discover what they can do themselves what their own capabilities are
DaliaMogahed_2012S-0003618-0003946 from oval offices to central squares
DaliaMogahed_2012S-0012688-0013069 so after analyzing mounds of data
DamianPalin_2012U-0002317-0003939 so what you're seeing here is the bacteria metabolizing and as they do so they create an electrical charge and this attracts metals from their local environment and these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria
DamonHorowitz_2011-0003872-0004166 let's do this
DamonHorowitz_2011-0008164-0008506 so i say to tony sorry
DamonHorowitz_2011-0013072-0013953 the project that begins in wonder what kant called admiration and awe at the starry sky above and the moral law within what can creatures like us know of such things
DamonHorowitz_2011X-0007226-0008425 i can look at your financial records i can tell if you pay your bills on time i know if you're good to give a loan to i can look at your medical records i can see if your pump is still pumping see if you're good to offer insurance to
DamonHorowitz_2011X-0023998-0024457 okay last question harder question
DamonHorowitz_2011X-0040808-0042691 if you've got two of something you add two more you get four that's true no matter what thing you're talking about it's an objective truth about the form of two the abstract form when you have two of anything two eyes two ears two noses just two protrusions those all partake of the form of two they all participate in the truths
DamonHorowitz_2011X-0060104-0060546 that's overwhelmed by the value of looking at
DamonHorowitz_2011X-0081423-0081683 good work
DamonHorowitz_2011X-0095350-0096546 we're the ones writing this opera this is our movie we figure out what will happen with this technology we determine how this will all end thank you
DanAriely_2008P-0015229-0016534 you must have seen this illusion if i asked you what's longer the vertical line on the table on the left or the horizontal line on the table on the right which one seems longer can anybody see anything but the left one being longer
DanAriely_2008P-0024772-0025503 i want you to think about illusion as a metaphor vision is one of the best things we do we have a huge part of our brain dedicated to vision bigger than
DanAriely_2008P-0030430-0031731 and this is one of my favorite plots in social sciences it's from a paper by johnson and goldstein and it basically shows the percentage of people who indicated they would be interested in giving their organs to
DanAriely_2008P-0042818-0044200 people don't check and they don't join the countries on the right the ones that give a lot have a slightly different form it says check the box below if you don't want to participate interestingly enough when people get this they again don't check
DanAriely_2008P-0054491-0055465 it's difficult and it's complex and it's so complex that we don't know what to do and because we have no idea what to do we just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us
DanAriely_2008P-0069057-0069923 now imagine i added a choice to the set that nobody wanted imagine i said a weekend in rome a weekend in paris or having your car stolen
DanAriely_2008P-0080939-0081015 but now if you
DanAriely_2008P-0095433-0096063 what is the general point the general point is that when we think about economics we have this beautiful view of human nature
DanAriely_2009-0005118-0005910 now you must have all taken a band aid off at some point and you must have wondered what's the right approach do you rip it off quickly short duration
DanAriely_2009-0015746-0015894 a carpenter's vice
DanAriely_2009-0027576-0028449 my interest in cheating started when enron came on the scene exploded all of a sudden and i started thinking about what is happening here is it the case that there was kind of a few bad apples
DanAriely_2009-0040161-0041310 you would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down people would cheat more but again this was not the case again a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit and they were insensitive to these economic incentives
DanAriely_2009-0051758-0051891 no cheating whatsoever
DanAriely_2009-0063595-0064934 so we did another experiment we got a big group of students to be in the experiment and we prepaid them so everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment and we told them that at the end we asked them to pay us back the money they didn't make
DanAriely_2009-0077489-0077937 we've learned that a lot of people can cheat they cheat just by a little bit
DanAriely_2009-0087734-0088445 lesson i learned when i went back to the nurses to talk to them so i went back to talk to them and tell them what i found out about removing bandages
DanAriely_2011U-0011447-0011654 none of those happened
DanAriely_2011U-0025568-0026030 the most difficult thing of course is to recognize that sometimes we too
DanAriely_2012X-0001504-0001679 labor and work
DanAriely_2012X-0010985-0012370 to work or behave in all kinds of ways and for me personally i started thinking about this after a student came to visit me this was a student that was one of my students a few years earlier
DanAriely_2012X-0019780-0020587 we gave them legos and we said hey would you like to build this bionicle for three dollars we'll pay you three dollars for it
DanAriely_2012X-0034825-0035675 the first thing that happened was that people built many more bionicles they built eleven versus seven in the meaningful condition versus the sisyphus condition
DanAriely_2012X-0048667-0049283 and the week before i showed up the ceo of this big software company went to that group two hundred engineers and
DanAriely_2012X-0065369-0065777 what happened in those three conditions
DanAriely_2012X-0079483-0079779 i can't say enjoy those pieces
DanAriely_2012X-0098286-0098438 so now this was tougher
DanAriely_2012X-0106383-0108326 and this is because our kids are so valuable not just because of who they are but because of us because they are so connected to us and because of the time and connection and by the way if you think that ikea instructions are not good think about the instructions that come with kids those are really tough
DanAriely_2012X-0117463-0118564 to decide on their own about how much effort attention caring how connected they feel to it are they thinking about labor on the way to work and in the shower and so on all of a sudden
DanBarber_2008P-0009565-0009783 is that it's so freakin delicious
DanBarber_2008P-0022055-0022232 all over the papers i read about
DanBarber_2008P-0031173-0031333 that about fifty times in the
DanBarber_2008P-0045130-0045487 on the outside so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators
DanBarber_2008P-0058490-0058634 for real is he making some
DanBarber_2008P-0069791-0070400 their dna is to find the conditions that are conducive to life to happiness
DanBarber_2008P-0080637-0081160 herbs you could taste spices and i kept i said you know i swear to god i tasted star
DanBarber_2008P-0087991-0088134 how come you don't give him this
DanBarber_2008P-0091658-0091826 it's a gift from god
DanBarber_2008P-0101326-0101682 and the jews fearing for their life had to come up with an ingenious idea or at least
DanBarber_2008P-0110124-0110318 take more sell more waste more
DanBarber_2008P-0117677-0118088 the great thing for chefs the great blessing for chefs
DanBuettner_2009X-0011633-0012371 the problem is only about one out of five thousand people in america live to be one hundred your chances are
DanBuettner_2009X-0025697-0026708 is the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body my body your body is about ninety years a little bit more for women
DanBuettner_2009X-0038690-0039532 but the real secret i think lies more in the way that they organize their society and one of the most salient elements of the sardinian society is how they treat
DanBuettner_2009X-0047923-0048805 we have in america one fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer big killers here in america and one sixth the rate of cardiovascular
DanBuettner_2009X-0064392-0065232 for this one hundred and two year old karate master his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art for this hundred year old fisherman
DanBuettner_2009X-0078504-0079316 they take their diet directly from the bible genesis chapter one verse where god talks about legumes and seeds
DanBuettner_2009X-0091124-0091695 and tears down the san bernardino freeway where she still volunteers for seven different organizations
DanBuettner_2009X-0110767-0111516 we know from the framingham studies that if your three best friends are obese there is a fifty percent better chance that you'll be overweight
DanCobley_2010G-0009025-0009354 the more massive a brand the more baggage it has
DanCobley_2010G-0029723-0030226 they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand
DanCobley_2010G-0040052-0040157 it's out of your control
DanCohen_2013X-0010954-0011668 what does it matter to me whether you have this idea that kant's theory works or mill's the right ethicist to follow
DanCohen_2013X-0023156-0023390 the argument as war is the dominant one
DanCohen_2013X-0032911-0033813 and finally this is really the worst thing arguments don't seem to get us anywhere they're dead ends they are roundabouts or traffic jams or gridlock
DanCohen_2013X-0047944-0048524 i don't have an answer but i have some suggestions and here's my suggestion
DanDennett_2002-0010276-0011086 climbing this blade of grass what's in it for the ant and the answer is nothing
DanDennett_2002-0023448-0024121 many people have laid down their lives for communism and many have laid down their lives for capitalism and many for catholicism and
DanDennett_2002-0039285-0039982 i'm responsible for what i say about memes actually i think we're all
DanDennett_2002-0053713-0054514 the shakers gift to be simple simple beautiful furniture and of course they're basically extinct
DanDennett_2002-0065588-0066262 he talks about how it was germs more than guns and steel that conquered
DanDennett_2002-0075265-0075854 one has only to glance at its press films fashion shows beauty contests ballrooms wine bars and broadcasting
DanDennett_2002-0089339-0090447 the germs what you can do however is foster public health measures and the like that will encourage the evolution of
DanDennett_2003-0015037-0015954 the internet encounter people who have very strong opinions about what's going to happen next but they probably don't think of these opinions
DanDennett_2003-0030920-0031938 this is a lovely book by a friend of mine named lee siegel who's a professor of religion actually at the university of hawaii and he's an expert magician and an expert on the street magic of india
DanDennett_2003-0042197-0043041 i'm sorry if i impose some clarity some understanding on you you'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks
DanDennett_2003-0060648-0061465 earlier today jeff hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades the way your eye moves around three or four times a second he didn't mention the speed
DanDennett_2003-0072280-0073435 you're familiar with a more recent technology which is there you can get a better view of the blobs see when you get close they're really just blobs of paint
DanDennett_2003-0084091-0084994 yes it's possible to do that but the details of the process are still in significant controversy and
DanDennett_2003-0100232-0101122 now if you think you see some pale yellow i'll run this a few more times look in the gray
DanDennett_2003-0107200-0108251 blank show the next picture for two hundred and forty milliseconds blank and keep going until the subject
DanDennett_2003-0119192-0119794 and yet it's pretty hard to see can you see it
DanDennett_2006-0003259-0003622 who designed it this is
DanDennett_2006-0012826-0013590 they have become domesticated and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years
DanDennett_2006-0026736-0027323 in primary school in high school in public schools in private schools and in home schooling
DanDennett_2006-0038703-0039380 them you can't own your children you have a responsibility to the world
DanDennett_2006-0048948-0049110 i don't think that's defensible
DanDennett_2006-0057554-0058338 whose clever move was it it was a clever move of natural selection itself francis crick
DanDennett_2006-0073585-0074502 over billions of years on a unique sphere chance has painted a thin covering of life complex improbable wonderful and fragile
DanDennett_2006-0087482-0088466 the word of god is the seed and the sower of the seed is christ same idea well not quite but in fact christians too
DanDennett_2006-0102139-0102529 every time you read it or say it you make another copy in your brain
DanDennett_2006-0114116-0115495 all the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is especially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact
DanDennett_2006-0132332-0133288 ever argue with the devil he's better at arguing than you are having had thousands of years to practice now rick warren didn't invent this clever move
DanDennett_2006-0143891-0145359 i don't believe it and i think this idea popular as it is not in this guise but in general is itself one of the main problems that we face if you are like me you know many wonderful
DanDennett_2009U-0009010-0009886 yes no do you know of any car that didn a t have a maker yes no if you answered yes for any of the above give details
DanDennett_2009U-0018007-0018129 we like it because
DanDennett_2009U-0025660-0026389 over six million years we and the chimps evolved our different ways we became bald bodied
DanDennett_2009U-0032312-0033114 for cuteness here a s a pretty good example it a s important that we love babies and that we not be put off by say messy diapers
DanDennett_2009U-0036788-0037758 my answer is it a s the same story the same story this is the hard one the one that isn a t obvious that a s why i leave it to the end and i won a t be able to say too much about it
DanGilbert_2004-0005172-0006067 and one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part called the frontal lobe and particularly a part called the pre frontal cortex
DanGilbert_2004-0018530-0019449 are equally happy with their lives now don't feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz because everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time
DanGilbert_2004-0033733-0034924 one minute's regret it was a glorious experience i believe it turned out for the best who are these characters who are so damn happy well the first one is jim wright some of you are old enough to remember he was the chairman of the house of representatives
DanGilbert_2004-0054167-0055137 what kind of economic engine would keep churning if we believed that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it
DanGilbert_2004-0065526-0066134 that's the synthesis of happiness now what's the right response to that yeah
DanGilbert_2004-0078754-0079402 the one i own is better than i thought the one i didn't own the one i left behind is not as good as i thought
DanGilbert_2004-0089512-0090018 what are you doing i'm helping people accept the things they cannot change indeed
DanGilbert_2004-0103756-0104439 think they're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose a little more than the one they left behind but
DanGilbert_2004-0115608-0116208 a trip to paris are just the same thing that seems like a one question
DanGilbert_2005G-0002443-0003240 and surely if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times that would be a tremendous gift
DanGilbert_2005G-0016773-0018182 but as it turns out this is not a very easy idea to apply in everyday life that's why americans spend more i should say lose more gambling than on all other forms of entertainment combined
DanGilbert_2005G-0031724-0032416 it's not interesting because it's so common it's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances of
DanGilbert_2005G-0043874-0044610 the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small look i can prove this to you here's a little lottery there's ten tickets in this lottery
DanGilbert_2005G-0059334-0060097 this is of course one of the most delicious tricks in marketing is to say something used to be higher and suddenly it seems like a very good deal
DanGilbert_2005G-0080329-0081682 most people don't want the most expensive they don't want the least expensive so they will opt for the item in the middle if you're a smart retailer then you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf because suddenly the thirty three dollar wine
DanGilbert_2005G-0089687-0090862 well look you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful of greasy salty crispy delicious snacks what's sitting in the corner of the room makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience
DanGilbert_2005G-0100087-0101232 you can see this is the problem of shifting comparisons because what you're doing is you're comparing the one hundred bucks to the purchase that you're making but when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison
DanGilbert_2005G-0116239-0117333 maybe that isn't so remarkable but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing when the delivery of these monetary units will happen
DanGilbert_2005G-0128404-0129326 sixty now or fifty in a month and these are subjective values and what you can see is our two rules are preserved people always think more is better than less sixty is always better than fifty
DanGilbert_2005G-0140625-0141620 that can destroy us and doom us are our own decisions if we're not here in ten thousand years it's going to be because we could not take advantage
DanGilbert_2005G-0161456-0162343 hundred and fifty feet from the mall when it blew up i went back to my hotel and the wedding that was planned was still going on and as the israeli mother said she said we never let them win by stopping
DanGilbert_2005G-0185691-0186568 economists tend to view the world through their own lenses which is this is just a bunch of stupid people and as a result many people look at economists as stupid people
DanGilbert_2005G-0198444-0199478 what will you look like how much hair will you have who will you be living with once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario suddenly we feel like it might be important to save so that that guy has a little retirement money
DanMeyer_2010X-0017723-0018723 and i'll put it to all of you what you already know that no problem worth solving is that simple i am very concerned about this because i'm going to retire in a world that my students will run
DanMeyer_2010X-0034149-0034952 in pairs journaling whatever and then eventually we realize it's getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left hand side of the screen
DanMeyer_2010X-0049314-0050510 off this right here is really fun for me because like the intro i teach kids because of my inexperience i teach the kids that are the most remedial all right and i've got kids who will not join a conversation about math because
DanMeyer_2010X-0065233-0066118 i put this problem on my blog recently in a grocery store which line do you get into the one that has one cart and nineteen items or the one with four carts and three five two and one items
DanPallotta_2013-0009929-0011036 and social business needs markets and there are some issues for which you just can't develop the kind of money measures that you need for a market i sit on the board of a center for the developmentally disabled
DanPallotta_2013-0019171-0020738 so in the for profit sector the more value you produce the more money you can make but we don't like nonprofits to use money to incentivize people to produce more in social service we have a visceral reaction to the idea that anyone would make very much money helping other people
DanPallotta_2013-0030586-0031797 it's cheaper for that person to donate one hundred thousand dollars every year to the hunger charity save fifty thousand dollars on their taxes so still be roughly two hundred and seventy thousand dollars a year ahead of the game
DanPallotta_2013-0045528-0046556 and if we tell the consumer brands you may advertise all the benefits of your product but we tell charities you cannot advertise all the good that you do where do we think the consumer dollars are going to flow
DanPallotta_2013-0057723-0059204 you don't have the same amount of time to find them as the for profit sector and you don't have a stock market with which to fund any of this even if you could do it in the first place and you've just put the nonprofit sector at an extreme disadvantage to the for profit sector on every level
DanPallotta_2013-0062758-0064141 well like most fanatical dogma in america these ideas come from old puritan beliefs the puritans came here for religious reasons or so they said but they also came here because they wanted to make a lot of money
DanPallotta_2013-0069100-0070165 financial incentive was exiled from the realm of helping others so that it could thrive in the area of making money for yourself and in four hundred years nothing has intervened
DanPallotta_2013-0080878-0081879 within just five years we had multiplied that five hundred and fifty four times into one hundred and ninety four million dollars after all expenses for breast cancer research
DanPallotta_2013-0089565-0090653 our sponsor went and tried the events on their own the overhead went up net income for breast cancer research went down by eighty four percent or sixty million dollars in one year
DanPallotta_2013-0098516-0100077 that would be an extra one hundred and fifty billion dollars a year in contributions and if that money could go disproportionately to health and human services charities because those were the ones we encouraged to invest in their growth that would represent a tripling of contributions to that sector
DanPhillips_2010X-0003224-0004160 are built from between seventy and eighty percent recycled material stuff that was headed to the mulcher the landfill the burn pile it was all just gone this is the first house i built
DanPhillips_2010X-0013613-0014344 a bathtub i made made out of scrap two by four here started with a rim there and then glued and nailed it up into a
DanPhillips_2010X-0026664-0027708 then another bathroom upstairs this light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle class foyer in america don't put it in the foyer put it in the shower or
DanPhillips_2010X-0038683-0039427 then we have a pattern because gestalt psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern over parts that comprise a pattern we'll go ooh that's
DanPhillips_2010X-0047164-0048255 feature blemish i feature organic process dead center john dewey apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste if something isn't perfect
DanPhillips_2010X-0055204-0055995 well i feature all those warped things because repetition creates pattern and it's from a dionysian perspective the fourth thing
DanPhillips_2010X-0070501-0070916 then when they degrade what do you do with them now all that
DanPhillips_2010X-0080270-0080436 but as soon as you walk in i go
DanPhillips_2010X-0094155-0095238 housing has become a commodity and it takes a little bit of nerve to dive into those primal terrifying parts of ourselves
DanPhillips_2010X-0106026-0106745 what we need to do is reconnect with who we really are and that's thrilling indeed thank you very much
DanielGoldstein_2011S-0017876-0019020 scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves when it comes to questions of temptation there is first the present self this is like odysseus when he's hearing the song
DanielGoldstein_2011S-0034648-0035558 i thought oh i'm sending myself mixed messages because not writing is bad but giving to charity is good so then i would kind of justify not writing by giving a gift
DanielGoldstein_2011S-0053290-0053648 that is to say we somehow might not believe
DanielGoldstein_2011S-0060804-0062729 once you find an investment that you're happy with what people do is they click done and the markers begin to disappear slowly one by one it simulates what it is like to invest in something and to watch that investment pan out at the end there will only be one marker left standing and it will determine our wealth in retirement
DanielGoldstein_2011S-0068610-0069608 so here i made a distribution builder where instead of showing numerical outcomes i show people what those outcomes will get you in particular apartments that you can afford
DanielGoldstein_2011S-0084598-0085241 here is somebody using the tool and just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider
DanielGoleman_2007-0003187-0003300 and bring it from the
DanielGoleman_2007-0012049-0012472 in what they were going to talk about and this is i think the predicament of our lives
DanielGoleman_2007-0021224-0022431 i came to my check to the seva foundation and i noticed that i thought boy my friend larry brilliant would really be happy that i gave money to seva then i realized that what i was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit
DanielGoleman_2007-0029995-0030083 research in the
DanielGoleman_2007-0043068-0043871 but that's not the most terrifying thing about him the scariest thing is that his iq is one hundred and sixty a certified genius
DanielGoleman_2007-0050470-0051732 the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences we're all unwitting victims of a collective blind spot we don't notice and don't notice that we don't notice the toxic molecules
DanielGoleman_2007-0058951-0059142 tend to have high rates of leukemia
DanielGoleman_2007-0065596-0066208 any store put your scanner on a palm onto a barcode which will take you to a website they have it for people with
DanielGoleman_2007-0074729-0075036 and people were just stepping over him hundreds and hundreds of people
DanielKraft_2009-0009937-0011161 so i'm thinking you know this procedure hasn't changed in about forty years and there is probably a better way to do this so i thought of a minimally invasive approach and a new device that we call the marrow miner this is it
DanielKraft_2011X-0009350-0010748 so if we start to think exponentially we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us and many of these technologies speaking as a physician and innovator we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of health care and to address many of the major challenges
DanielKraft_2011X-0024660-0025875 and essentially learn how to reconstruct and maybe even re engineer or backwards engineer the brain so we can better understand pathology disease and therapy we can look inside with real time fmri in the brain at real time
DanielKraft_2011X-0047232-0047913 there's watches coming out that will measure your heart rate the zeo sleep monitors a whole suite of tools that can enable you to leverage and have insight into your own health
DanielKraft_2011X-0070258-0071867 artificial retinas the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see again in early trials but moving into the future these are going to be game changing or for those of us who are sighted how about having the assisted living contact lens bluetooth wifi available beams back images to your eye now
DanielKraft_2011X-0083255-0084433 leveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenomics how my genes modulate what my drugs do and what doses i need are going to become increasingly important and once in the hands of the individual and the patient will make better drug dosing and selection available
DanielKraft_2011X-0094699-0095594 and we're entering the era of personalized oncology the ability to leverage all of this data together analyze the tumor and come up with a real specific cocktail for the individual patient
DanielLibeskind_2009-0002038-0002862 is not knowledge neither is it ignorance it's something which is suspended between what we believe we can be and a tradition we may have forgotten
DanielLibeskind_2009-0014496-0015524 complete ecstasy that the future can be better and it is that belief that i think drives society and today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us and yet it is in times like this
DanielLibeskind_2009-0026739-0028020 it's like the old las vegas used to be it's about conserving emotions conserving the traditions that have obstructed the mind in moving forward and of course what is radical is to confront them and i think our architecture is a confrontation with our own
DanielLibeskind_2009-0040773-0041533 a source though the source is unknown though we don't have to be mystical about it we realize that the hand has been given us by
DanielLibeskind_2009-0053525-0054410 with history that is often very difficult to grapple with it to create a position that is beyond our normal expectations
DanielLibeskind_2009-0067840-0068734 mannered in any source but a space that might be cool in terms of its temperature might be refractive to our desires a space
DanielLibeskind_2009-0080097-0080771 again memory is the city memory is the world without the memory there would be no story to tell there would be nowhere to turn
DanielLibeskind_2009-0093783-0094552 these are the spaces that are not just luxurious spaces for some of us but are important for everybody in this world so again
DanielLibeskind_2009-0108863-0109735 i came from the bronx i was taught not to be a loser not to be somebody who just gives up in a fight you have to fight for what you believe you don't always win everything you want to win
DanielPauly_2010Z-0029047-0029808 and over time it changes it changes because people do things or naturally every generation
DanielPink_2009G-0007175-0007481 thank you i never
DanielPink_2009G-0025365-0026406 if you want people to perform better you reward them right bonuses commissions their own reality show incentivize them that's how business
DanielPink_2009G-0035608-0036300 so glucksberg did another experiment similar to this where he presented the problem in a slightly different way like this up here
DanielPink_2009G-0046461-0047342 more right brained creative conceptual kinds of abilities think about your own work think about your own work
DanielPink_2009G-0054457-0055338 give you an example of what i mean let me marshal the evidence here because i'm not telling you a story i'm making a case ladies and gentlemen of the jury some evidence dan ariely one of the great
DanielPink_2009G-0062872-0063079 the worst of all
DanielPink_2009G-0069278-0070104 impact on overall performance there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does
DanielPink_2009G-0083287-0083430 it looks like less than half
DanielPink_2009G-0094071-0094785 how they do it when they do it where they do it is totally up to them meetings in these kinds of environments
DanielPink_2009G-0106993-0107705 but that unseen intrinsic drive the drive to do things for their own sake the drive to do things cause they matter and here's the best part
DanielSuarez_2013G-0018956-0019867 now i think knowing this we can take decisive steps to preserve our democratic institutions to do what humans do best which is adapt
DanielSuarez_2013G-0032914-0033658 plausible deniability now we live in a global economy
DanielSuarez_2013G-0046159-0046700 and this perfectly suits the targeting needs of autonomous weapons
DanielSuarez_2013G-0057561-0058872 and this is why we need an international treaty on robotic weapons and in particular a global ban on the development and deployment of killer robots now we already have
DanielSuarez_2013G-0072922-0073928 they should notify humans to their presence and in certain very high security areas perhaps civic drones would snare them and drag them off to a bomb disposal facility
DanielTammet_2011-0005308-0005764 if i give you my date of birth can you tell me what day of the week i was born on
DanielTammet_2011-0016892-0017348 can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it's pointing you towards
DanielTammet_2011-0026832-0027144 and the space they create in the middle
DanielTammet_2011-0034487-0034694 there is a procession of syllables
DanielTammet_2011-0040728-0041273 is put those two pictures together in our mind something like this
DanielTammet_2011-0052465-0052651 words like numbers
DanielTammet_2011-0062705-0063044 i hope that i've given you the desire to learn to see the world
DanielWolpert_2011G-0009658-0010950 or perceiving the color of a rose if it doesn't affect the way you're going to move later in life now for those who don't believe this argument we have trees and grass on our planet without the brain but the clinching evidence is this animal here the humble sea squirt
DanielWolpert_2011G-0021215-0022505 but with vast computers we approximate and come close to the optimal solution when it comes to being dexterous it's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous and we'll see you have to both perceive and act on the world which has a lot of problems
DanielWolpert_2011G-0041370-0042489 you want to generate beliefs about the world so what are beliefs beliefs could be where are my arms in space am i looking at a cat or a fox but we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities
DanielWolpert_2011G-0063770-0064154 now i get an extra source of sensory information due to that external act
DanielWolpert_2011G-0080745-0081381 now when i screamed at my children to stop sometimes they would both say to me the other person hit them harder
DannyHillis_1994-0001698-0002841 i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be and i thought that since i was among friends here
DannyHillis_1994-0041012-0041508 was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction
DannyHillis_1994-0075038-0075255 so
DannyHillis_2010P-0010549-0010774 a healthy restaurant and a sick restaurant
DannyHillis_2010P-0017994-0018764 but most things you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen because mostly sick people used to be healthy people they have the same genome
DannyHillis_2010P-0028608-0029294 so for instance by measuring the genome we've learned a lot about how we're related to other kinds of animals
DannyHillis_2010P-0053329-0055172 and build robots that would measure proteomics and so we did that and working with david we made a little company called applied proteomics eventually which makes this robotic assembly line which in a very consistent way measures the protein and i'll show you what that protein measurement looks like
DannyHillis_2010P-0070248-0071178 that allows them to respond to this drug we might not even know what this protein is but we can see it's a marker for the response to the disease so
DannyHillis_2010P-0089425-0089715 imagine we didn't know anything about plumbing
DannyHillis_2010P-0112514-0113145 give them a little chemotherapy maybe a little radiation of course we'll do surgery sometimes and so on but
DannyHillis_2013-0013622-0013894 to their ability to each according to their need
DannyHillis_2013-0029743-0030452 so for a few hours it all passed through china now china telecom says it was just an honest mistake
DannyHillis_2013-0042422-0042789 so in other words it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it
DannyHillis_2013-0050658-0051109 for the most part internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it
DannyHillis_2013-0059316-0060497 so if you see one of these maps of the internet it's just somebody's guess nobody really knows what the internet is right now because it's different than it was an hour ago it's constantly changing it's constantly reconfiguring
DaphneBavelier_2012X-0003008-0004236 this is in this context i'm going to tell you about video games when we say video games most of you think about children it's true ninety percent of children do play video games
DaphneBavelier_2012X-0021806-0022263 that's a statement about vision there may be vision scientists among you
DaphneBavelier_2012X-0038284-0040060 so clearly playing those action games doesn't lead to attention problems actually those action video game players have many other advantages in terms of attention and one aspect of attention which is also improved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world
DaphneBavelier_2012X-0067866-0069128 you can't compare the effect of multimedia tasking and the effect of playing action games they have totally different effects on different aspects of cognition perception and attention
DaphneBavelier_2012X-0090663-0091100 we then force them to play ten hours of action games
DaphneKoller_2012G-0012395-0013941 finally even for those who do manage to get the higher education the doors of opportunity might not open only a little over half of recent college graduates in the united states who get a higher education actually are working in jobs that require that education
DaphneKoller_2012G-0035422-0036176 so what made these courses so different after all online course content has been available for a while
DaphneKoller_2012G-0055384-0057255 percent are zoned out on facebook and then there's the smarty pants in the front row who blurts out the answer before anyone else has had a chance to think about it and i as the instructor am terribly gratified that somebody actually knew the answer and so the lecture moves on before really most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked
DaphneKoller_2012G-0067801-0069302 so we had to come up with a different solution and the solution we ended up using is peer grading it turns out that previous studies show like this one by saddler and good that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades
DaphneKoller_2012G-0081836-0082931 some of these were physical study groups along geographical constraints and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets this is the san francisco study group but there were ones all over the world
DaphneKoller_2012G-0095221-0095944 so this personalization is something that one can then build by having the virtue of large numbers
DaphneKoller_2012G-0114407-0115132 so there's been many studies including this one that show that if you use active learning interacting with your students in the classroom
DaveEggers_2008-0007756-0008139 grown up around a lot of teachers my mom was a teacher my sister became a teacher
DaveEggers_2008-0018954-0019315 well right now i'm trying that clock has got me
DaveEggers_2008-0030983-0031769 beautiful wooden floors whitewashed beams and it had the look while we were renovating this place somebody said you know it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship
DaveEggers_2008-0037928-0038585 this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in this is replacement eyes in case you lose one
DaveEggers_2008-0040741-0041111 this is the fish theater which is just a saltwater tank with three seats
DaveEggers_2008-0050271-0050842 we never put it together you know and so then around that time
DaveEggers_2008-0064828-0065638 this is a problem but you know there's something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day working one on one getting all this attention they go home
DaveEggers_2008-0077441-0078152 the teachers that we work with and everything is different to teachers they tell us what to do we went in there thinking we're ultimately completely malleable you're going to tell us
DaveEggers_2008-0094332-0094631 this is near the planks we sell all the
DaveEggers_2008-0103464-0104257 happy accident so all the people i used to know in brooklyn they said well why don't we have a place like that here and a lot of them had been former educators or would be educators
DaveEggers_2008-0116297-0117551 this is i just want to emphasize locally funded locally built all the designers all of the builders everybody was local all the time was pro bono i just came and visited and said yes you guys are doing great or whatever that was it you can see the time in all five boroughs of new york in the back
DaveEggers_2008-0131164-0131355 now i'm going to the ted wish
DaveMeslin_2010X-0001586-0001982 often do we hear that people just don't care
DaveMeslin_2010X-0013244-0013444 so you're never going to see them on a billboard
DaveMeslin_2010X-0026827-0028164 that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead or someone tells you that you're part of a prophecy they're missing the most important characteristic of leadership which is that it comes from within it's about following your own dreams uninvited
DaveMeslin_2010X-0038787-0038948 but we can change all those
DavedeBronkart_2010X-0011635-0013561 they have been saying that since the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s now i'm going to step back in history this is from july one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine i was a freshman in college and this was when we first landed on the moon and it was the first time we had ever seen from another surface that's the place where you and i are right now where we live
DavedeBronkart_2010X-0025558-0025783 for me it was nine zero am
DavedeBronkart_2010X-0043193-0043366 and i'm thinking what
DavedeBronkart_2010X-0057971-0058742 and i went through a mental exercise actually because i started a patient support community of my own on a website
DavedeBronkart_2010X-0066596-0067009 final weeks in the hospital one of the things that she discovered
DavedeBronkart_2010X-0077599-0077883 well thank you that shot the timing
DavedeBronkart_2010X-0087383-0088488 inflammation and she saw that if there is no inflammation then the scan is a uniform gray so she took it and the radiologist report
DavidAgus_2009P-0003876-0004977 where his parents drove him from new york city to upstate new york to get an experimental therapy for at the time hodgkin's disease which saved his life he makes remarkable points here
DavidAgus_2009P-0015635-0016596 you know i know very well as a cancer doctor i can't treat advanced cancer so as an aside i firmly believe
DavidAgus_2009P-0027033-0027914 get to new ways of treating it as i'll show you so one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer is that right now we describe it by a number of adjectives symptoms
DavidAgus_2009P-0041625-0042543 there's also a field of proteomics that i'll talk about in a few minutes which i think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease
DavidAgus_2009P-0055070-0055998 all made a mistake myself included by focusing down by being a reductionist we need to take a step back and believe it or not there were hisses in the audience people got upset
DavidAgus_2009P-0066073-0066766 and a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here are really different than we
DavidAgus_2009P-0080143-0080817 reduced occurrence of cancer by a drug that doesn't even touch the cancer so the notion you change the soil
DavidAgus_2009P-0091765-0092564 but if you start to look at it that red that dark color there more than seventy five percent of the population of those countries are obese
DavidAgus_2009P-0103065-0103820 and this is her cat scan and so what this is is we're taking a cross section of her body here and you can see in the middle there is her heart
DavidAgus_2009P-0115601-0116920 lived much longer and did better than people who got placebo so it challenged everything we knew in cancer is that you don't need to get a response you don't need to shrink the disease if we slow the disease
DavidAgus_2009P-0132167-0132959 the magnet spins them around and then there's a detector at the end when it hit that detector is dependent on the mass and the charge
DavidAnderson_2013X-0007409-0008181 in two thousand and thirteen if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis you go to your doctor and what do you get a questionnaire
DavidAnderson_2013X-0021848-0022444 otherwise we're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines and suffering the consequences
DavidAnderson_2013X-0040596-0042461 well one of the ways that we can start is to try to come up with some general characteristics or properties of emotion like states such as arousal and see if we can identify any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties
DavidAnderson_2013X-0048577-0049294 in which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench
DavidAnderson_2013X-0054412-0055057 so now we wanted to try to understand something about what controls the duration of this state
DavidAnderson_2013X-0066602-0066768 oh my god
DavidAnderson_2013X-0084652-0085677 the learning deficit is rescued the flies learn well but they're still hyperactive what that tells us is that dopamine is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup
DavidBinder_2012G-0010563-0011069 and her father peered out the window to see what all the noise and commotion was about
DavidBinder_2012G-0021779-0022485 but from brighton to rio to perth something new was emerging and these festivals were really different
DavidBinder_2012G-0037408-0038385 so back to back takes site specific theater and uses it to gently remind us about who and what we choose to edit out of our daily lives
DavidBinder_2012G-0048307-0049005 case in point when the sultan's elephant came to london just nine months after seven seven
DavidBismark_2010G-0006868-0007778 you see even if the idea of the election is perfect running a countrywide election is a big project and big projects are messy
DavidBismark_2010G-0011046-0012020 voting booth to fill out your vote when you come back out you get to drop your vote into the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes so that no one knows how you voted
DavidBismark_2010G-0016952-0017277 and sometimes we even have to trust computers
DavidBismark_2010G-0023671-0023835 well the way we've come up with
DavidBismark_2010G-0032438-0033817 you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt and after the close of the election you can check that your vote was counted by comparing your receipt to the vote on the website
DavidBlaine_2009P-0005926-0007065 the one after that i stood on top of a hundred foot pillar for thirty six hours i began to hallucinate so hard that the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads
DavidBlaine_2009P-0020715-0020853 my first try
DavidBlaine_2009P-0029208-0029320 so that clearly wasn't
DavidBlaine_2009P-0043675-0045054 just hold and relax and never let any air out and just hold and relax through all the pain every morning this is for months i would wake up and the first thing that i would do is i would hold my breath
DavidBlaine_2009P-0053869-0055095 thinner i was the longer i was able to hold my breath and by eating so well and training so hard my resting heart rate dropped to thirty eight beats per minute which is lower than most olympic athletes
DavidBlaine_2009P-0059999-0060139 i was completely wrong
DavidBlaine_2009P-0064432-0064817 by seven eight i started to black out
DavidBlaine_2009P-0075048-0076001 the neurosurgeon pulled me out of the water because in his mind at fifteen minutes your brain is done you're braindead so he pulled me up and i was fine
DavidBlaine_2009P-0085921-0087090 so i started full focus i completely trained to get my breath hold time up for what i needed to do but there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it being on oprah
DavidBlaine_2009P-0097654-0098560 i figured oprah had dedicated an hour to doing this breath hold thing if i had cracked early it would be a whole show about how depressed i am so
DavidBlaine_2009P-0116244-0116809 like yeah he said if you really held your breath that long why'd you come out of the water dry
DavidBolinsky_2007-0005242-0006673 as awe ful things by meaning they are things you can worship they are ideals that are powerful they are irreducible they are unique they are useful sometimes often a long time after the fact
DavidBolinsky_2007-0017396-0018105 want to do that to our students so we have an opportunity to really open up education and i had a telephone call
DavidBolinsky_2007-0029989-0030769 to make new discoveries and to be able to find out really how life works so we set out by looking at
DavidBolinsky_2007-0042382-0043134 interact with each other they pass information to each other they cause different things to happen inside the cell and the cell will actually
DavidBolinsky_2007-0055572-0055701 these micro machines
DavidBrooks_2011-0017683-0018368 that for centuries we've inherited a view of human nature based on the notion that we're divided selves
DavidBrooks_2011-0040437-0041396 you see them on the mountains up there they're cross country skiing up the mountain with these grim expressions that make dick cheney look like jerry lewis
DavidBrooks_2011-0060713-0062140 and so when we see another person we reenact in our own minds what we see in their minds when we watch a car chase in a movie it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase when we watch pornography it's a little like having sex
DavidBrooks_2011-0073648-0074753 and those people who have models of how to relate have a huge head start in life scientists at the university of minnesota did a study in which they could predict with seventy seven percent accuracy at age eighteen months
DavidBrooks_2011-0085575-0086156 the third is what you might call sympathy the ability to work within groups
DavidBrooks_2011-0100464-0102444 before about the fusion of our souls into one higher level entity about the fact that at the core of both our souls lay our identical hopes and dreams for our children about the notion that those hopes were not separate or distinct hopes but were just one hope one clear thing that defined us both
DavidBrooks_2011-0108168-0109363 now we are discovering a more accurate vision of the unconscious of who we are deep inside and it's going to have a wonderful and profound and humanizing effect on our culture thank you
DavidByrne_2010-0006720-0007722 other places around the country had similar rooms this is tootsie's orchid lounge in nashville the music was in some ways different but in structure and form
DavidByrne_2010-0017745-0018861 create reverberation and confuse the rhythms the instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification etc etc it's no accident it's perfect for that particular context
DavidByrne_2010-0035066-0035799 this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet no more eating drinking and yelling at the stage or
DavidByrne_2010-0050484-0050571 went even further
DavidByrne_2010-0068135-0068954 there's one other kind of new venue the private mp three player presumably this is just for christian music and
DavidByrne_2010-0078028-0078543 the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their
DavidByrne_2010-0093747-0094735 we sing and like the birds the joy is still there even though we have changed what we do to fit the context thank you very much
DavidCameron_2010-0010044-0010851 or to improve government or to improve so many of the things that politicians talk about so what follows from that is that if you think
DavidCameron_2010-0026533-0027556 gone from a world of local control then we went to a world of central control and now we're in a world of people control local power central power
DavidCameron_2010-0038896-0039567 now what does this mean for our politics for our public services for our government well i can't in the time i've got
DavidCameron_2010-0054011-0054797 who does best at infection control all of the information that would once be locked in the department of health is now available for all of us to see
DavidCameron_2010-0068505-0069341 all the proof from america is actually if you pay people to recycle if you give them a carrot rather than a stick you can transform their behavior
DavidCameron_2010-0078939-0079977 but now with the huge advances in information technology with the massive changes in behavioral economics with all that we know about how you would advance well being
DavidCarson_2003-0008536-0008852 tonight so with that
DavidCarson_2003-0021902-0022836 i'm sure a lot of you are aware that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last five years or so it's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more
DavidCarson_2003-0034873-0035637 book i did on intuition i think it's not the only ingredient in design but possibly the most important it's something everybody has
DavidCarson_2003-0040888-0041674 like this for a couple of reasons if you've had any design courses they would teach you you can't read this i think you eventually can and more importantly i think it's true
DavidCarson_2003-0047811-0048440 under four hundred pages now but i decided i liked this contents page i liked the way it looks so i kept it
DavidCarson_2003-0061378-0062200 and water everywhere and spiders and i thought you know what where they thinking you'd think maybe cement possibly or something but anyway i
DavidCarson_2003-0077465-0078707 i felt this was one of the more successful solutions the students actually cut them up and put them up around bars and restaurants that night and i just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the
DavidCarson_2003-0092161-0092380 and then as the agency explained to me they said look
DavidCarson_2003-0109749-0109778 and
DavidCarson_2003-0126806-0127745 i'm sure she never found the dog because i took the sign but i was asked to give a talk at a conference in sacramento a few years back and the theme was courage
DavidChristian_2011-0009859-0010325 what we see around us is staggering complexity
DavidChristian_2011-0023213-0023496 so let's do it
DavidChristian_2011-0037526-0038563 so where you get slightly denser areas gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms so we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds
DavidChristian_2011-0051778-0053050 so chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force that operates over smaller scales than gravity which explains why you and i are smaller than stars or planets now what are the ideal conditions for chemistry
DavidChristian_2011-0065300-0066418 and dna also copies itself so it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean so the information spreads notice that information has become part of our story
DavidChristian_2011-0079622-0080187 we are blessed with a language a system of communication so powerful and so precise
DavidChristian_2011-0091855-0093712 here we are back at the convention center we've been on a journey a return journey of thirteen point seven billion years i hope you agree that this is a powerful story and it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role but it also contains warnings
DavidDeutsch_2005G-0001261-0002550 we've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising so i'll try and do that but i want to start with two things that everyone already knows
DavidDeutsch_2005G-0014826-0015818 is this a typical place well let's look around you know and look in a random direction and we see a wall and chemical scum
DavidDeutsch_2005G-0027231-0028020 and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer
DavidDeutsch_2005G-0033375-0034519 now how do we know about an environment that's so far away and so different and so alien from anything we're used to well the earth our environment in the form of us
DavidDeutsch_2005G-0038964-0039634 back out in the form of tremendous jets which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of i think it's a trillion
DavidDeutsch_2005G-0050439-0051729 its structure contains with ever increasing precision the structure of everything this place and not other places in the universe is a hub which contains within itself
DavidDeutsch_2005G-0061645-0062441 falling down on every square meter of the earth for billions of years before that and will continue to fall on for billions of years afterwards
DavidDeutsch_2005G-0071314-0072083 not resources and the same well if we could do that we'd automatically have an energy supply because the transmutation would be a fusion reactor
DavidDeutsch_2005G-0088252-0089417 it depends not on chance but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time the danger is not at all unprecedented species go extinct all the time
DavidDeutsch_2005G-0101686-0102666 when we know of an impending disaster and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself then there's not going to be much argument really
DavidDeutsch_2009G-0002634-0003369 our ancestors looked up at the night sky and wondered what stars are wondering therefore
DavidDeutsch_2009G-0018574-0019334 and other ancient mysteries and new unexpected phenomena that all that
DavidDeutsch_2009G-0033525-0034460 priests traditions and rulers which is why the scientific revolution had to have a wider context the enlightenment
DavidDeutsch_2009G-0046479-0047586 but it doesn't you know what the clinching evidence was that space time is curved it was a photograph not of space time but of an eclipse with
DavidDeutsch_2009G-0061199-0061982 requiring her to return regularly and lets her go and each year she is magically compelled to return
DavidDeutsch_2009G-0071662-0072439 to take revenge on hades with her spring powers she cools his domain with spring air
DavidDeutsch_2009G-0083955-0085032 the theory would have been refuted but now the fact that it's also a good explanation hard to vary makes the crucial difference
DavidDeutsch_2009G-0098028-0098941 about the physical world it's a fact that is itself unseen yet impossible to vary thank you
DavidDow_2012X-0011636-0012331 will eventually joined a gang and committed a number of very serious crimes
DavidDow_2012X-0017169-0017950 where the most ardent death penalty supporters and the most vociferous abolitionists
DavidDow_2012X-0027695-0029370 so what all of these death row inmates had to do was rely on volunteer lawyers to handle their legal proceedings than there were lawyers who had both the interest and the expertise to work on these cases
DavidDow_2012X-0049561-0050053 was not the exception to the rule he was the rule
DavidDow_2012X-0059264-0059491 the way we solve this problem
DavidDow_2012X-0066484-0066835 rocket science my client will
DavidDow_2012X-0087651-0088075 if we think about nudging them rather than just punishing them
DavidDow_2012X-0101665-0101847 from when i was five years old
DavidGallo_1998-0007365-0007947 it's mostly unexplored and yet there are beautiful sights like this that captivate us and make us become familiar with it but
DavidGallo_1998-0020277-0021067 we see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths they go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet they come right up to the submarine they'll put their eyes right up to the window
DavidGallo_1998-0031402-0032264 this is what's called a hydrothermal vent and what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed hydrogen sulfide rich water coming out of a volcanic
DavidGallo_1998-0058511-0059236 you see this white v shaped mark on the back of this shrimp it's actually a light sensing organ it's how they find the hydrothermal vents
DavidGallo_1998-0070482-0071197 from a human perspective is toxic as hell not only that but on top the lifeblood that plumbing system turns off
DavidGallo_2007-0010036-0010884 we find more life we think and diversity and density than the tropical rainforest which tells us that we don't know much about this planet at all there's still ninety seven percent
DavidGallo_2007-0025329-0026094 and if you're an octopus or a cephalopod you really understand how to use your surroundings to hide in the next scene you're going to see a nice coral bottom
DavidGriffin_2008-0007684-0008268 these are camels moving across the rift valley in africa photographed by chris johns
DavidGriffin_2008-0021726-0022851 now i have to tell you i was talking to kyle last week about this that i was going to tell this story and he said oh yeah i remember that too i remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me
DavidGriffin_2008-0033258-0034205 these are baboons at a watering hole nick the camera again an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this and nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of
DavidGriffin_2008-0048107-0048733 jonas bendiksen a very energetic photographer came to me and said we need to document this and here's my
DavidGriffin_2008-0057166-0057858 i've seen sort of ok pictures of bycatch the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species
DavidGriffin_2008-0065474-0066566 took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the american wounded coming out of iraq it is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home on the other
DavidGriffin_2008-0075619-0076308 here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear and then everybody kind of runs out and goes out
DavidHanson_2009-0002878-0003704 so we're starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces make eye contact with you
DavidHanson_2009-0016796-0017604 and there is billions of dollars being spent on that character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy so if they achieve human level intelligence or
DavidHoffman_2007-0005076-0005224 that we will call sputnik
DavidHoffman_2007-0018366-0018932 and vint cerf points out that sputnik led directly to arpa and the internet and of course nasa
DavidHoffman_2008-0006085-0006254 the first one the one i shot my
DavidHoffman_2008-0018024-0018332 film burns i mean this was sixteen millimeter safety film
DavidHolt_2004-0010125-0010308 double outhouse over here on the side
DavidHolt_2004-0024046-0024080 so i
DavidHolt_2004-0051824-0052547 my mom didn't put up with much either and she was driving and she said you boys you think you can have anything you want you don't know how hard it is to earn money
DavidHolt_2004-0061399-0061589 all around as people started singing
DavidHolt_2004-0071103-0072252 of music not even aware of it but that day in the cotton field out there picking when those people started singing i realized i was in the very heart of real music and that's where i've wanted to be
DavidHolt_2004-0087985-0088122 this instrument pretty much saved my
DavidHolt_2004-0102994-0103148 what i always do
DavidHolt_2004-0124121-0125134 of stuff and we put a pipe in the vice there and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe drilled a hole in the back of the pipe took some of our firecrackers pulled out the fuses tied them together put them in the back there
DavidHolt_2004-0129944-0130451 we said well what are you going to do with it they said we're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel
DavidHolt_2004-0135880-0136351 so i like to invent things too and i think i'll close put my set with something i invented a good while back
DavidKeith_2007S-0005846-0006803 this is the growth rate of co two in the atmosphere you've seen this in various forms but maybe you haven't seen this one what this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating
DavidKeith_2007S-0024007-0024125 and it was done not by us
DavidKeith_2007S-0037220-0038094 but it made exactly this point so in a sense there's not much new the one new thing is this essay so i should say i guess that since the time of
DavidKeith_2007S-0062375-0063054 we're building that box the scientists and the engineers of the world are building it piece by piece in their labs even when they're doing it for other reasons
DavidKeith_2007S-0074284-0074901 nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this but here's a case which is harder to reject
DavidKeith_2007S-0087071-0088054 a very small amount of money would get us some many of us maybe now me think we should do that but i have a lot of reservations my reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem
DavidKelley_2002-0009529-0010555 this year we're carrying this treo which we had a lot to do with and helped handspring design it also though we designed it a few years ago it's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so this
DavidKelley_2002-0022670-0023315 but i thought you might be interested in seeing some of our work over the last year and how it responds in video
DavidKelley_2002-0037334-0037443 a year and a half ago
DavidKelley_2002-0047133-0047899 the next video is not done by us this is cbs sunday morning they aired about two weeks ago scott adams
DavidKelley_2002-0063963-0065034 wander around and gather information in a straightforward fashion about the recycling process and what's being done and how they're going to reuse the water once it comes through the
DavidKelley_2002-0077923-0078115 it becomes your eyes and ears as
DavidKelley_2002-0089673-0090854 this is one guy doing this this is a pretty spectacular thing so we're in the process of helping them design deep well low cost manual pumps in order for these people who have a quarter acre
DavidKelley_2012-0004849-0005368 and brian's shoulders sank and he wadded up the clay horse and he threw it back in the bin
DavidKelley_2012-0017571-0018511 and so i went to see him because he has just worked on phobias for a long time which i'm very interested in he had developed this
DavidKelley_2012-0025402-0025676 and they'd eventually touch the snake
DavidKelley_2012-0028064-0028577 i love that term guided mastery and something else happened
DavidKelley_2012-0037034-0037590 so i thought one of the things i'd do today is take you through and show you what this journey looks like
DavidKelley_2012-0045344-0045523 and this is what he came up with
DavidKelley_2012-0054104-0054453 a few years ago i felt a lump on the side of my neck
DavidLogan_2009-0005185-0006265 noticed as we began to debrief various super bowl parties is that it seemed to us that across the united states if you will tribal councils had convened
DavidLogan_2009-0020884-0021865 and nudge them forward along these tribal stages to what we call stage five which is the top of the mountain but we're going to start with what we call stage one
DavidLogan_2009-0035713-0036385 what kind of innovation would get done the amount of world changing behavior that would happen in fact it would be basically
DavidLogan_2009-0050394-0050520 we are and they don't care
DavidLogan_2009-0057215-0058132 for which desmond tutu won the nobel prize now think about that south africa terrible atrocities had happened in the society and people came together
DavidLogan_2009-0062880-0064134 i don't want to talk stage one that's like you know life sucks who wants to talk that way i don't want to talk like they do at the particular dmv that's close to where dave lives i really don't want to just say i'm great because that kind of sounds narcissistic and then i won't have any friends
DavidLogan_2009-0079933-0081195 they were then my life wouldn't suck but i don't so it does so i'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything in fact that's progress we move people from stage one to stage two by getting them in a new tribe and then over time
DavidLogan_2009-0095648-0096254 but the question on the table is this what kind of an impact are the tribes that you are
DavidMacaulay_2002-0007283-0008275 i could talk about something that i'm known for something that would be appropriate for the more sort of technically minded people here or i could talk about something that i care about
DavidMacaulay_2002-0018556-0019387 though piazzas that are humanly scaled part of the reason is that they grew it organically that amazing juxtaposition of old and new
DavidMacaulay_2002-0037764-0038514 of pouring down the hill unfortunately just across the road from it or quite close by is the column of marcus aurelius and
DavidMacaulay_2002-0049703-0050405 anyway the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff unfortunately when she goes to unwrap the
DavidMacaulay_2002-0070375-0070479 the big front door
DavidMacaulay_2002-0077554-0078791 so you can see the top of sant'ivo and the pyramid of cestius and the tempietto of bramante all side by side in this amazing space now that's one drawing well i thought maybe it's time for piranesi to meet
DavidMacaulay_2002-0087760-0089201 so it becomes slightly three dimensional i could take you down one of those narrow streets into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold double foldout page which if you were like me reading a pop up book as a child you hopefully stick your head into
DavidMacaulay_2002-0102807-0103988 spell his name and fly around and he finally gets enough strength together to sort of climb up the ladder onto the roof and all the pigeons a la red balloon are there waiting for him and they carry him off over the walls of the city
DavidMacaulay_2002-0114478-0115571 narrow escape we swoop down over the campo de fiori this is one of those things i to show to my students because it's a complete bastardization a denial of any rules of perspective
DavidMackay_2012X-0004812-0004998 and in the year two thousand
DavidMackay_2012X-0018590-0019519 perhaps there's an issue to do with areas and in this talk i'd like to talk about land areas and ask is there an issue about areas the answer is going to be
DavidMackay_2012X-0030616-0030943 purple is central america
DavidMackay_2012X-0043325-0044342 the united kingdom is consuming one point two five watts per square meter so's germany and japan is consuming a bit more
DavidMackay_2012X-0058228-0058552 and so this facility delivers fourteen watts per square meter
DavidMackay_2012X-0074419-0076187 so let's talk about three more big levers that could really help on the consumption side first transport here are the physics principles that tell you how to reduce the energy consumption of transport and people often say oh yes technology can answer everything we can make vehicles that are a hundred times more efficient and that's almost true let me show you
DavidMackay_2012X-0093674-0094743 and the old meter readings are shown in the top half of the graph and then two thousand and seven is shown in green at the bottom and that was when i was reading the meter every week and my life changed because i started
DavidMcCandless_2010G-0001632-0002898 all suffering from information overload or data glut and the good news is there might be an easy solution to that and that's using our eyes more so visualizing information so that we can see the patterns and connections that matter
DavidMcCandless_2010G-0017004-0017749 that you can explore with your eyes a kind of map really a sort of information map and when you're lost in information an information map is kind of useful
DavidMcCandless_2010G-0034847-0035567 a huge amount of information and data and we irrigate it with networks and connectivity and it's been worked and tilled by unpaid workers and governments
DavidMcCandless_2010G-0050172-0051030 but it wasn't like i was amazingly brilliant at it but more like i was sensitive to the ideas of grids and space and alignment and typography
DavidMcCandless_2010G-0067873-0068593 so to be fair and to alter our perspective we have to bring in another data set and that data set is gdp or the country's earnings who has the biggest budget
DavidMcCandless_2010G-0089911-0090744 this is a visualization of the political spectrum in an attempt for me to try and understand how it works and how the ideas
DavidMcCandless_2010G-0099754-0100876 so just to wrap up i wanted to say that it feels to me that design is about solving problems and providing elegant solutions and information design
DavidPerry_2006-0004999-0006353 the school teachers weren't having much fun the sports were very dirty or very painful so i cleverly chose rowing which i got very good at and i was actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day and i flipped over right in front of the entire school
DavidPerry_2006-0018038-0018784 color computer he's recognized as being the father of video games in europe he's a multi millionaire and i think that's why he's smiling in this photograph
DavidPerry_2006-0029704-0030474 but he got great terms on it this purchase included mining and hunting rights ownership of all land on the island and a castle with no furniture included
DavidPerry_2006-0058587-0059254 i came across a student who's absolutely excellent at expressing himself and this student agreed that he would
DavidPerry_2006-0076126-0076636 from an early age i learned to invest myself emotionally in what unfolded before me on screen
DavidPerry_2006-0088350-0089276 a well designed video game will seamlessly weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience as one becomes more experienced the awareness of physical control melts
DavidPerry_2006-0099480-0100279 to some degree i've learned how to drive from the game the sensory cues are very similar it's a funny feeling when you have spent more time doing something on the tv
DavidPerry_2006-0113491-0114235 elements as well video games give an awful lot of other things too and that's why people get so addicted the most important one being fun
DavidPizarro_2012X-0005386-0007164 the reason is we have sort of a built in poison detector you can see this as early as even in newborn infants if you are willing to do this you can take a couple of drops of a bitter substance or a sour substance and you'll see that face the tongue stick out the wrinkled nose as if they're trying to get rid of what's in their mouth
DavidPizarro_2012X-0031214-0032922 the philosopher martha nussbaum points this out in this quote thus throughout history certain disgust properties sliminess bad smell stickiness decay foulness have been repeatedly and monotonously been associated with jews women homosexuals untouchables lower class people all of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt of the body
DavidPizarro_2012X-0049887-0050640 this data set also allowed us to statistically control for a number of things that we knew were both related to political orientation and to disgust sensitivity
DavidPizarro_2012X-0063354-0064761 and by and large the results have all been the same that when people are feeling disgust their attitudes shift towards the right of the political spectrum toward more moral conservatism as well so this is whether you use a foul odor a bad taste
DavidPogue_2006-0001892-0002118 hello voicemail my old friend
DavidPogue_2006-0009613-0010029 but you get me and you listen to
DavidPogue_2006-0023673-0024582 the entire operating system this is the good part the entire operating system fit in two hundred and eleven k you couldn't put the mac os ten logo in two hundred
DavidPogue_2006-0032338-0032775 well if you like that one how much time have we got another one
DavidPogue_2006-0038266-0039595 it's more like joining a club where you pay dues every year and every year they say we've added more features and we'll sell it to you for ninety nine dollars i know one guy who's spent four thousand dollars just on photoshop over the years
DavidPogue_2006-0046786-0046888 this
DavidPogue_2006-0054959-0056361 tends to be let's break it down let's just make it more steps there are these wizards everywhere and you know there's a new version of windows coming out this fall if they continue at this pace there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up
DavidPogue_2006-0068521-0069659 i'm not saying that apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity palm is also especially in the old days wonderful about this i actually got to speak to palm when they were flying high in the
DavidPogue_2006-0078051-0078596 i put my software and ibm together i got profit and
DavidPogue_2006-0088260-0089001 good simple interface designs i liked the media center pc i liked the microsoft spot watch the wireless watch
DavidPogue_2006-0099157-0099213 and
DavidPogue_2006-0110984-0111871 and i'm sure every one of you have done this at some point in your lives or one of your children you walk along and i'm about to pull this onto the floor i don't care it's
DavidPogue_2006-0123933-0124899 and so that's what they did this cult of doing things right is starting to spread so my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology remember if it doesn't work
DavidPogue_2007-0010667-0010788 they say we're young
DavidPogue_2007-0019559-0019718 have dropped every year
DavidPogue_2008P-0014409-0015096 try out skype for the first time which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad they don't want to pay the international fees
DavidPogue_2008P-0023872-0023920 but
DavidPogue_2008P-0038614-0039605 if you start a call on your cellular network and you come home you keep being billed which is why most people with this service get into the habit of saying hey i just got home can i call you right back
DavidPogue_2008P-0055641-0056564 i'm going to tell you how to avoid that now what you're going to use is google cellular it's totally free there's not even ads if you know how to send a text message you can get the same information for
DavidPogue_2008P-0077857-0078447 who are being paid twenty cents per answer as you can imagine it's college kids and old people
DavidPogue_2008P-0090921-0091908 so now i'm going to tell you how to get out of that there are these services that transcribe your voicemail into text and they send it to either your email or as
DavidPogue_2008P-0099920-0101013 this is micheal hope you're doing well i'm fine here everything's good hey i was walking along the street and the sky was blue
DavidPogue_2008P-0108774-0109673 and at that moment your phone will ring and you're like i'm sorry i've got to take this the really beautiful thing is you know when somebody's sitting next to you sometimes they can sort of
DavidPogue_2008P-0125816-0125911 we had
DavidPogue_2008P-0137124-0137265 from a different band with the same
DavidPogue_2008P-0153524-0153572 a
DavidPogue_2013U-0013577-0014869 also when it comes to cell phones on all phones if you want to redial somebody that you've dialed before all you have to do is hit the call button and it puts the last phone number into the box for you
DavidPogue_2013U-0026445-0027363 shutter lag is the time between your pressing the shutter button and the moment the camera actually snaps it's extremely frustrating on any camera under one thousand dollars
DavidRockwell_2002-0009708-0010572 so many in fact that seeing has become a bit of a problem but i think that people are very frustrated that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on
DavidRockwell_2002-0018819-0019067 your work is highly sensual
DavidRockwell_2002-0022373-0023448 and whose neighborhood was devastated and as someone who works less than a mile from there that i was in the role of forcing one hundred people who work
DavidRockwell_2002-0029887-0030162 and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something
DavidRockwell_2002-0041873-0042909 that had to do with long term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city and the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled and there was talk
DavidRockwell_2002-0054566-0055261 was a very powerful experience so we went back to the city and said we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a
DavidRockwell_2002-0062942-0063383 so the first thing we had to do was find a way to
DavidRockwell_2002-0076360-0076810 but i think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of new yorkers
DavidRockwell_2002-0083881-0083970 we just felt it had
DavidRockwell_2002-0092799-0093209 where you get the three hundred and sixty degree view but the design was driven by a need to be
DavidRockwell_2002-0103658-0104351 so the notion of collaboration i think this reinforces how important that is and in terms of the temporary nature of it
DavidRockwell_2002-0108083-0108570 sacred piece of land is to be used having it come out of actually seeing it
DavidRockwell_2002-0111777-0112127 do you have having been as physically
DavidRockwell_2002-0120982-0121994 i think there's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities and why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day
DavidRockwell_2002-0129149-0129658 piece of digital video of the experience of being on
DavidSRose_2007U-0003306-0004002 into companies who have been pitching me with powerpoint presentations so i think it's safe to say i know a little bit about the process of pitching
DavidSRose_2007U-0018540-0019463 next up is knowledge if you're telling me you're going to be the great developer of the map of the human genome you'd better know what a human genome is i mean i want you to have domain expertise
DavidSRose_2007U-0039813-0041036 also got to let me know that there are touchstones you want to tie in to the rest of the world out there so for example if you reference companies i've heard of or basic items in your business i want to know about them things that i can relate to
DavidSRose_2007U-0072729-0073494 then comes the ask this is where you tell me how much you actually want to get you're looking for five million at what kind of valuation two million at one hundred thousand
DeanKamen_2002-0007625-0008232 i would love to talk about the technology and sometime in what's past the fifteen minutes i'll be happy
DeanKamen_2002-0025573-0026548 over the last hundred years we started building cars and then over the fifty years we've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence
DeanKamen_2002-0038053-0038443 it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive it's not sustainable
DeanKamen_2002-0048949-0049936 railroad then an airplane every other form of transportation's been improved in five thousand years we've gone backwards in getting around cities
DeanKamen_2002-0057536-0058803 to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space i took this down to ground zero and knocked my way through crowds for an hour i'm a pedestrian but the law typically lags technology by a generation or two and
DeanKamen_2002-0069497-0069817 one of the more exciting things that occurred to us about
DeanKamen_2002-0077466-0077935 and the camera is down at her and this guy has to put the microphone in her face said what do you mean by that
DeanKamen_2002-0087259-0087994 and they took it to washington they showed them and they're going to be involved now watching how these things get absorbed
DeanKamen_2002-0100712-0101356 that's segway this is a stirling cycle engine this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing
DeanKamen_2002-0108432-0109290 which at night is enough electricity in the rest of the world as mister holly doctor holly pointed out can run computers and a light bulb
DeanKamen_2002-0115014-0115747 we figured out how to put a vapor compression distiller on this thing with a counter flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat then using
DeanKamen_2007-0007978-0008177 that technology's just not available right now
DeanKamen_2007-0016125-0016322 got up to twenty some odd people
DeanKamen_2007-0022744-0023343 and paint it in three d exact mirror image of their other limb so you won't see all the really cool stuff
DeanKamen_2009P-0008387-0008679 few years ago i was visited by the guy that runs darpa
DeanKamen_2009P-0017921-0018123 we gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it
DeanKamen_2009P-0025446-0025672 be completely self contained including all its power
DeanKamen_2009P-0031636-0032445 trust me i've got a day job i've got a lot of day jobs most of my day job keeps me busy funding my fantasies like first and water and power and i've got a lot
DeanKamen_2009P-0040335-0040559 people with a desire to do something
DeanKamen_2009P-0048049-0048095 you keep
DeanKamen_2009P-0058378-0058532 i'll give you some astounding things
DeanKamen_2009P-0067834-0068253 i could give you fine motor control or i could let you curl forty pounds
DeanKamen_2009P-0074668-0075091 and he made a few comments and the meeting ended we said goodbye to all these
DeanKamen_2009P-0085059-0085453 he's got no arms he's got a small residual limb on one side
DeanKamen_2009P-0094754-0094808 you need to
DeanKamen_2009P-0103858-0104183 those are political questions economic questions strategic
DeanKamen_2009P-0108264-0108404 one hundred feet
DeanKamen_2009P-0111733-0111921 because of what it can do and how it
DeanOrnish_2004-0006350-0007608 really about our nature is to be happy our nature is to be peaceful our nature is to be healthy and so it a s not something happiness is not something you get health is generally not something that you get but rather all of these different practices
DeanOrnish_2004-0025162-0025950 i got this as a christmas card a few years ago from two of the patients in one of our programs the younger brother is eighty six the older one a s ninety five they wanted to show me how much
DeanOrnish_2004-0047805-0048883 eighty nine ninety ninety one you get a new category fifteen to twenty percent ninety two ninety three ninety four ninety five ninety six ninety seven you get a new category
DeanOrnish_2004-0064339-0065536 now the problem with the atkins diet everybody knows people who have lost weight on it but you can lose weight on amphetamines you know and fen phen i mean there are lots of ways of losing weight that aren a t good for you you want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health rather than the one that harms it
DeanOrnish_2004-0079873-0081045 and then i wondered was there any relationship between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle whichever group they were in and the changes in psa and sure enough we found a dose response relationship just like we found in the arterial blockages in our cardiac studies
DeanOrnish_2006-0001294-0002176 with all the legitimate concerns about aids and avian flu and we'll hear about that from the brilliant doctor brilliant later today i want to talk about the other pandemic which is
DeanOrnish_2008-0001276-0001955 to change our genes is to make new ones as craig venter has so elegantly shown another is to change our lifestyles and
DebRoy_2011-0001917-0002676 everything you said everything you did available in a perfect memory store at your fingertips so you could go back
DebRoy_2011-0018541-0018698 the influence of social
DebRoy_2011-0039880-0041017 based on the following idea every time my son would learn a word we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard that contained that word and we would plot
DebRoy_2011-0054596-0055007 these little knots of two colors of thread we call social hot spots
DebRoy_2011-0071101-0072349 and you have the recipe for taking this idea to a whole new place we've started analyzing television content using the same principles analyzing event structure of a tv signal
DebRoy_2011-0087402-0088802 of social graphs and how they relate to content and we can now start to probe the structure in interesting ways so if we for example trace the path of one piece of content that drives someone
DebRoy_2011-0105470-0106070 database all these recordings i'm going to hand off to you and to your sister who arrived two years later
DeborahGordon_2003-0004949-0005786 they all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers
DeborahGordon_2003-0011550-0011616 and i go there
DeborahGordon_2003-0018044-0019012 and then the newly mated queens fly off somewhere drop their wings dig a hole and go into that hole and start laying eggs and they will
DeborahGordon_2003-0029081-0030050 and i know how colony size changes as a function of colony age because i've dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants
DeborahGordon_2003-0042239-0043529 territorial chemical in the garbage so what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse on one day it'll all be here and then the next day they'll move it over there and then they'll move it back so that's what the midden workers do
DeborahGordon_2003-0056659-0057704 and once they belong to the ants that work outside they never go back down now ants most ants including these don't see very well they have eyes they can distinguish between light and dark
DeborahGordon_2003-0071598-0072343 which was surprising to a lot of people was that ants actually switch tasks the same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole life
DeborahGordon_2003-0085632-0086557 the outcome that i see these predictable dynamics in who does what task and it would change as the colony gets larger and what
DeborahGordon_2003-0101740-0102875 this is taken through a fiber optics microscope it's down inside the nest in the beginning you just see the ants just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope but the idea is that the ants are in there
DeborahGordon_2003-0114991-0116008 something that they're doing is clearly successful enough that this pattern of haphazard contacts in the aggregate produces something that allows ants to make a lot more ants
DeborahRhodes_2010W-0001634-0002919 there are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives and women in whom it doesn't work well at all
DeborahRhodes_2010W-0006014-0006172 i'm not a radiologist
DeborahRhodes_2010W-0016996-0017545 the radiologists were in turn criticized for protecting their own financial self interest
DeborahRhodes_2010W-0025817-0027022 if the breast is less than twenty five percent dense that's called fatty replaced the next category is scattered fibroglandular densities followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense
DeborahRhodes_2010W-0036577-0036788 and what have we gained from that investment
DeborahRhodes_2010W-0047376-0048016 and he made the case that scientific discoveries are rarely the product of one individual's genius
DeborahRhodes_2010W-0056795-0058008 but the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge bulky tubes and they were filled with these scintillating crystals and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors
DeborahRhodes_2010W-0068423-0069884 to say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system
DeborahRhodes_2010W-0079611-0080414 but the mbi image shows that tumor much more clearly as well as a second tumor which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options
DeborahRhodes_2010W-0086566-0087483 and in this case a forty five year old medical secretary at mayo who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young wanted to enroll in our study
DeborahRhodes_2010W-0092873-0094071 shows a normal digital mammogram but an mbi image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer so this is not just young women that it's benefiting it's also older women with dense tissue
DeborahRhodes_2010W-0106513-0107029 the mbi unit has now been fda approved but it's not yet widely available
DeborahRhodes_2010W-0113784-0114213 but i do believe that all women forty and older should have an annual mammogram
DeborahRhodes_2010W-0122199-0123316 after undergoing biopsies that further increased her risk for cancer and losing her sister to cancer she made the difficult decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy
DeborahScranton_2007-0010503-0011364 so what that meant was when i went down to fort dix i had to hop out in front of one hundred and eighty guys and tell them of my vision you can imagine the hailstorm of questions i got
DeborahScranton_2007-0028308-0028642 and i'd like to relate an experience i had here at ted
DeborahScranton_2007-0045121-0045445 advised we're leaving taji right now we believe that the
DeborahScranton_2007-0065489-0066461 ten of them agreed to take cameras in total twenty one ended up filming five soldiers filmed the entire time there are three featured in the film the way i learned about taji was
DeborahScranton_2007-0080871-0081610 we have to be able to go into scary places where we may you know we think we know but we just have to leave that little bit of openness to
DeborahScranton_2007-0090441-0090634 in his eyes and he wasn't going to blink
DeborahScranton_2007-0095676-0095829 when i talk about a disconnect
DeeBoersma_2010Z-0004292-0005200 so the fundamental problems that we face are over consumption and too many people it's the same problems in the galapagos except obviously
DeeBoersma_2010Z-0017633-0018445 so they have all the criteria that people normally like but scientifically they're amazing because they're sentinels they tell us about
DeeBoersma_2010Z-0032530-0033241 so it's a real desert for not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas things die when there's no food
DeeBoersma_2010Z-0048149-0049157 they have to have ballast at some point so when they're empty they have the ballast water in there when they come back they actually dump this oily ballast water into the ocean why do they do that because it's cheaper
DeeBoersma_2010Z-0060211-0061316 and what the penguins show us and these are all the little dots from where the penguins positions were for penguins in incubation in two thousand and three and what you see is some of these individuals are going
DeeBoersma_2010Z-0066487-0067452 you having a job in chicago and then you get transferred to st louis and your mate is not happy about this because you've got to pay airfare
DeeBoersma_2010Z-0074546-0075587 not that different from us they're trying to make a living they're trying to raise their offspring they're trying to get on and survive in the world and this is turbo the penguin
DeeBoersma_2010Z-0086787-0087450 this is my box up here and this is the system that works you can see this penguin he goes over he looks at those wires
DenisDutton_2010-0005962-0006164 a central california landscape
DenisDutton_2010-0015366-0015991 taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease
DenisDutton_2010-0026993-0027850 which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment
DenisDutton_2010-0036586-0036904 now keeping these ideas firmly in mind
DenisDutton_2010-0048909-0049632 or a road perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline that extends into the distance
DenisDutton_2010-0060482-0061240 when homo erectus started shaping single thin stone blades sometimes rounded
DenisDutton_2010-0070988-0072404 tools fashioned to function as what darwinians call fitness signals that is to say displays that are performances like the peacock's tail except that unlike hair and feathers the hand axes
DenisDutton_2010-0082551-0083748 for us moderns virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies to express intense emotions with music painting and dance
DeniseHerzing_2013-0003468-0004248 well we know a few things we know that their brain to body ratio which is a physical measure of intelligence is second only to humans
DeniseHerzing_2013-0015560-0017045 now young dolphins learn a lot as they're growing up and they use their teenage years to practice social skills and at about the age of nine the females become sexually mature so they can get pregnant and the males mature quite a bit later at around fifteen years of age
DeniseHerzing_2013-0041451-0043428 now scientists have used keyboard interfaces to try to bridge the gap with species including chimpanzees and dolphins this underwater keyboard in orlando florida at the epcot center was actually the most sophisticated ever two way interface designed for humans and dolphins to work together under the water and exchange information
DeniseHerzing_2013-0058359-0058885 now this is video of a session the diver here has a rope toy
DeniseHerzing_2013-0079628-0080141 well chat is designed specifically to empower the dolphins to request things from us
DennisHong_2009X-0008406-0008997 just like a pendulum we call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion what you're doing is
DennisHong_2009X-0016865-0017923 the second robot i want to talk about is called impass it stands for intelligent mobility platform with actuated spoke system so it's a wheel leg hybrid robot so think of
DennisHong_2009X-0023272-0023584 anything like this out there this is a very high
DennisHong_2009X-0032885-0033549 five years ago i actually worked at nasa jpl during the summer as a faculty fellow and they already had a six legged robot
DennisHong_2009X-0051022-0051540 now this robot is currently our star robot we actually have a fan club for the robot darwin
DennisHong_2009X-0065669-0065892 in a more exciting
DennisHong_2009X-0078725-0079454 four am in the morning what do you expect right so i need to decipher what i wrote but sometimes i see this ingenious idea in there
DennisHong_2009X-0095373-0096495 do not forget to have fun that's really the secret of our success we're having too much fun i truly believe that highest productivity comes when you're having fun and that's what we're doing there you go thank you so much
DennisHong_2011-0016534-0018026 so all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer and the computer can do two things one is first of all process this information to have an understanding of the environment these are the lanes of the road there's the obstacles and convey this information to the driver
DennisHong_2011-0044494-0044851 now i understand why there is braille on a drive up atm machine
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P-0005167-0005671 now that's a lot a lot of bees and that's really important and
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P-0014882-0016313 to these other diseases and we don't have the answer to that yet and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out we think perhaps it's a combination of factors we know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P-0028870-0029602 in the same room and they're all engaged and they're getting along and they're all there because of the passion for bees
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P-0041983-0042881 you know they pick up their hives they move their families once or twice in a year and if you look at florida in dade city florida that's where all the pennsylvania beekeepers go
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P-0057833-0059086 another apple tree that's a different type of pollen and bees are very faithful when they're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower they stay to that crop exclusively in order to help generate and of course
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P-0068760-0069436 and they wait for that mother to fly away they go in eat the egg and lay their own egg there so they don't do any work and so
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P-0084912-0086219 in fact you know the white house used to have sheep in front in order to help fund the war effort in world war i which probably is not a bad idea it wouldn't be a bad idea i want to say this not because i'm opposed completely to mowing lawns i think that there is perhaps some
DennisvanEngelsdorp_2008P-0096036-0096934 and it includes those meadows and that journey that journey of transformation that occurs as you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees or you watch those native bees there
DerekSivers_2009I-0010578-0011478 so for example there are doctors in china who believe that it's their job to keep you healthy so any month you are healthy you pay them and when you're sick you don't have to pay them because they failed at their job
DerekSivers_2010G-0004529-0005883 well bad news you should have kept your mouth shut because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen
DerekSivers_2010U-0001680-0002592 at ted we talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement so let's watch a movement happen start to finish in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it
DerekSivers_2010U-0013538-0014640 we might have missed the real lesson here the biggest lesson if you noticed did you catch it is that leadership is over glorified that yes it was the shirtless guy was first and he'll get all the credit
DevduttPattanaik_2009I-0008282-0008422 what matters more
DevduttPattanaik_2009I-0021521-0022115 the naked wise man we don't know who he was perhaps he was a jain monk
DevduttPattanaik_2009I-0036307-0037105 because you see the greeks believed you live only once and when you die you have to cross the river styx
DevduttPattanaik_2009I-0049446-0050167 great images of mother goddesses are built and worshiped for ten days and what do you do at the end of ten days you dunk it in
DevduttPattanaik_2009I-0063049-0063875 in design but if you look at cultures which have cyclical and based on infinite lives you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic
DevduttPattanaik_2009I-0081802-0083015 when they were dealing with india example please tell us the process to invoice hospitals step a step b step c mostly
DevduttPattanaik_2009I-0096729-0097513 the keys and then you remove the blindfold and invariably you see a tear because the penny has dropped
DianaLaufenberg_2010X-0009525-0010857 in the time that passes between when i was a kid in high school and when i started teaching we really see the advent of the internet right about the time the internet gets going as an educational tool i take off from wisconsin and move
DianaLaufenberg_2010X-0025137-0025961 is responsible and respectful and they know what to do with it and so we chose to look at paul rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who
DianaLaufenberg_2010X-0047001-0047602 good color and there's some and they went through all that we processed out loud and i said go read it and they're like
DianaLaufenberg_2010X-0057713-0058516 and everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities
DianaNyad_2011P-0012591-0012825 it was an old dream that was lingering
DianaNyad_2011P-0024402-0025854 but honestly i sort of led i was the team leader and to get the government permissions you read in the paper you think it's easy to get into cuba everyday try going in with an armada like we had of fifty people and five boats and cnn
DianaNyad_2011P-0036743-0037293 but no for some reason i couldn't wait to get into the dark of the night and be singing
DianaNyad_2011P-0044110-0045035 this was it this was our time and i reminded myself a couple hours in you know the sport is sort of a microcosm of life itself
DianaNyad_2011P-0058498-0058852 bonnie i think i'm going to die my breath
DianaNyad_2011P-0078955-0079728 swim in a bathing suit like normal and no joke this is it it came from the shark divers i finished the swim like this
DianaNyad_2011P-0094838-0095530 i said nope i didn't know and now i'm going to live to eighty five i have three more years than i thought
DianeBenscoter_2009U-0008351-0009177 i started going out on cases and after about five years of doing i was arrested for kidnapping
DianeBenscoter_2009U-0018049-0018231 this is the leg of a suicide bomber
DianeBenscoter_2009U-0028562-0028769 the most dangerous part of this
DianeBenscoter_2009U-0035641-0036255 and so this is something that through research and education i believe that we can solve
DianeKelly_2012P-0012566-0014190 and the slide behind me barely scratches the surface of how widespread they are in animals there's an enormous amount of anatomical variation you find muscular tubes modified legs modified fins as well as the mammalian fleshy inflatable cylinder that we're all familiar with
DianeKelly_2012P-0025375-0025722 but one like this one
DianeKelly_2012P-0040737-0041525 and that was because every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found in nature up to that point had the same basic elements it had the central fluid
DianeKelly_2012P-0062590-0063970 he couldn't have been more wrong i really believe that we still have a lot to learn about the normal structure and function of our bodies not just about its genetics and molecular biology but up here in the meat end of the scale
DiannaCohen_2010Z-0010622-0011488 i began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so
DiannaCohen_2010Z-0023549-0024349 so this is a big issue for us another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about is we've added a fourth r
DidierSornette_2013G-0011928-0012294 we developed a theory called dragon kings
DidierSornette_2013G-0028156-0029102 now some of you may have come to the mind that is this not related to the black swan concept you have heard about frequently
DidierSornette_2013G-0036053-0036917 the point is that many times during bubbles there are positive feedbacks which can be of many times such that
DidierSornette_2013G-0045388-0047222 from seven months of pregnancy a mother starts to feel episodic precursory contractions of the uterus that are the sign of these maturations toward the instability giving birth to the baby the dragon king
DidierSornette_2013G-0063449-0064120 in recent history again many interesting stories for each of them let me tell you just one or two
DidierSornette_2013G-0082172-0082530 we identify excesses bubbles
DidierSornette_2013G-0099614-0101021 and so that never again will extremes and crises like the great recession or the european crisis take us by surprise thank you
DimitarSasselov_2010G-0011854-0013212 now the connection between biology and dna and life is very tantalizing when you talk about copernicus because even back then his followers very quickly made the logical step
DimitarSasselov_2010G-0024018-0024970 the telescope is actually built similarly to the well known to you hubble space telescope except it does have an additional lens a wide
DimitarSasselov_2010G-0037755-0038575 times the size of the earth and that was of course mercury venus mars and of course the earth and then the two big giant planets
DimitarSasselov_2010G-0049907-0050858 the planets which are marked like earth definitely more than any other planets that we see and now for the first time we can say that
DimitarSasselov_2010G-0063408-0064308 on earth past and present from microbes to us humans in its rich molecular diversity the way we now understand life
DimitarSasselov_2010G-0075797-0076834 on earth looks like like this and they really help molecules like nucleic acids like rna and dna stay inside develop
DimitarSasselov_2010G-0087626-0088453 time now it's about something else but it's equally profound and half the time what's happened
DimitarSasselov_2010G-0097295-0098189 do you know what the size of life in this necktie will be it will be the size of a single small atom
DonLevy_2012U-0003451-0004185 moviemakers had developed an arsenal of techniques to further their deceptions
DonNorman_2003-0001678-0002722 yeah people used to say you know norman's ok but if you followed what he said everything would be usable but it would be ugly well i didn't have that in mind so
DonNorman_2003-0018295-0019079 the weird thing is google lies because if i type design and emotion it says you don't need the and we do it anyway
DonNorman_2003-0031873-0032788 this is an iq test and it determines how well you do in life would you tie those two strings together so they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here and
DonNorman_2003-0038167-0039094 but in fact if that's how you always were you'd never get any work done because you'd be working along and say oh i got a new way of doing it so to get work done you've got to set a deadline right
DonNorman_2003-0045722-0047039 and when people are finished they don't throw it away they keep it for you know it's like the old wine bottles you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again which proves it's not the water it's all about the visceral experience
DonNorman_2003-0064834-0065622 head that's watching and saying that's good that's bad or why are you doing that i don't understand it's that little voice in your head that's the seat of consciousness
DonTapscott_2012G-0003642-0004111 yesterday's internet was a platform for the presentation of content
DonTapscott_2012G-0021473-0022792 the guy in the picture here i'll tell you his story his name is rob mcewen i'd like to say i have this think tank we scour the world for amazing case studies the reason i know this story is because he's my neighbor
DonTapscott_2012G-0049060-0049672 they had a technology disruption and rather than taking a business model innovation to correspond to that
DonTapscott_2012G-0065121-0066146 for these kids it was a military tool to defend unarmed people from murderers it was a tool of self defense you know as we speak today
DonTapscott_2012G-0076893-0077823 concept of progress you were born you lived your life and you died but then johannes gutenberg came along with his great invention and over time
DonTapscott_2012G-0095318-0096244 it's an openness it's a sharing of all kinds of information not just about location and trajectory and danger and so on but about food sources
DonaldSadoway_2012-0003964-0004189 the difference would have to be made up
DonaldSadoway_2012-0011778-0012997 is only a small part so i'm not here today only to tell you how my team at mit has drawn out of nature a solution to one of the world's great problems i want to go full spectrum
DonaldSadoway_2012-0023018-0023332 and the need for grid level storage is compelling
DonaldSadoway_2012-0031595-0032575 in fact i looked to a technology that neither stores nor generates electricity but instead consumes electricity huge amounts of it

DonaldSadoway_2012-0076811-0078022 and one variant of the technology has us stacking these bistro tabletops into modules aggregating the modules into a giant battery that fits in a forty foot shipping container for placement in the field
DonaldSadoway_2012-0087098-0088507 to develop liquid metal battery i hired students and post docs and mentored them in a battery i strive to maximize electrical potential when mentoring i strive to maximize human potential
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008-0006969-0007769 as for that first sphere of work i think what abraham lincoln's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008-0014469-0014901 moreover when his mother lay dying she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008-0029005-0029995 for each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strengths and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008-0041827-0042395 but before i finished the chief of the barbarians stood up and said but wait you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008-0053334-0053662 the theme of the article was how to remove lyndon johnson from power
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008-0071429-0072203 but it was too late despite all that power all that wealth he was alone when he finally died his ultimate terror realized
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008-0081980-0083227 to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of general washington in the only outhouse where he'd have to encounter it they figured he'd be upset about the indignity of george washington being in an outhouse but he came out of the outhouse not upset at all
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008-0099499-0100858 and i had to say that i wished that various new york yankees players would break arms legs and ankles so that the brooklyn dodgers could win their first world series he said how often do you make these horrible wishes and i had to say every night when i said my
DorisKearnsGoodwin_2008-0110073-0110816 really can live on so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the stories of their lives thank you for letting me be that
DorisKimSung_2012X-0009381-0009924 on mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar heated spaces
DorisKimSung_2012X-0015756-0016313 if we look at biology and many of you probably don't know i was a biology major before i went into architecture
DorisKimSung_2012X-0026897-0028270 it's a sun shading device so that when the sun hits the surface it constricts the amount of sun passing through and in other areas it's a ventilating system so that hot trapped air underneath can actually move through and out when necessary
DorisKimSung_2012X-0040361-0041918 and so you can imagine even in this application that in a high rise building where the panel systems go from floor to floor up to thirty forty floors the entire surface could be differentiated at different times of day depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface
DrHawaAbdiandDrDeqoMohamed_2010W-0004925-0005494 people where seventy five percent of them are women and children pat mitchell and this is your hospital
DrewBerry_2011X-0007487-0008819 to look at the moon and he transformed our understanding of the moon the perception in the seventeenth century was the moon was a perfect heavenly sphere but what galileo saw was a rocky barren world which he expressed through his watercolor painting
DrewBerry_2011X-0021424-0022766 and so what i'm about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual dna replication machine that's occurring right now inside your body at least two thousand and two biology so dna's entering the production line from the left hand side
DrewBerry_2011X-0035412-0035643 when the cell feels it's ready to go
DrewBerry_2011X-0045916-0047238 it's also an attention sensing system it's able to feel when the cell is ready when the chromosome is correctly positioned it's turning green here because it feels that everything is just right and you'll see there's this one little last bit that's still remaining red
DrewBerry_2011X-0051542-0052076 discovering this stuff is certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science
DrewCurtis_2012-0009404-0010518 now my company fark deals with news ostensibly and as a result we were not in violation of this patent so case closed right wrong
DrewCurtis_2012-0023000-0023633 well during the settlement process when we received our copy i struck it my attorney said nah no chance of that
DrewDudley_2011X-0002775-0003488 and i've come to realize that we have made leadership into something bigger than us we've made into something beyond us we've made it about changing the world
DrewDudley_2011X-0019359-0019956 and i know this is cheesy and i don't know why i'm telling you this but in that moment when everyone was laughing i knew that i shouldn't quit
DrewDudley_2011X-0030202-0031030 marianne williamson said our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate our greatest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light and not our darkness that frightens us
DyandeNapoli_2011X-0008423-0010325 on june twenty third two thousand a ship named the treasure sank off the coast of cape town south africa spilling one thousand three hundred tons of fuel which polluted the habitats of nearly half the entire world population of african penguins now the ship sank between robben island to the south
DyandeNapoli_2011X-0022586-0023195 through those doors and into the building it was eerily silent
DyandeNapoli_2011X-0038323-0040119 so three of those penguins peter pamela and percy wore satellite tags and the researchers crossed their fingers and hoped that by the time they got back home the oil would be cleaned up from their islands and luckily the day they arrived it was so it had been a huge gamble but it had paid off
DyandeNapoli_2011X-0056752-0058340 and in addition about three thousand penguin chicks were rescued and hand raised and again we know from long term monitoring that more of these hand raised chicks survive to adulthood and breeding age than do parent raised chicks
EOWilson_2007-0002592-0002618 i have
EOWilson_2007-0020496-0020527 and
EOWilson_2007-0045963-0046002 be
EOWilson_2007-0087918-0088071 of years each is
EOWilson_2007-0124833-0124858 on
EOWilson_2012P-0023497-0024434 in mathematical skills don't worry many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathematically semi literate
EOWilson_2012P-0066146-0067796 there are thousands of professionally delimited subjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry to biology and medicine and on then into the social sciences where it is possible in short time to acquire the status of an authority
EOWilson_2012P-0082712-0084696 for the solution of which those particular objects of research are ideally suited find out what they are you'll find your own way to discover to learn to teach the decades ahead will see dramatic advances in disease prevention
EWidder_2010Z-0006326-0007543 and the reason i turned out the lights is because i knew i would see this phenomenon of animals making light called bioluminescence but i was totally unprepared for how much there was and how spectacular it was
EWidder_2010Z-0018207-0019587 now when i was first doing this all i was trying to do was count the number of sources i knew my forward speed i knew the area so i could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter but i started to realize that i could actually identify animals by the type of flashes they produced
EWidder_2010Z-0032719-0033475 and it's been equated to the invention of the microscope in terms of the impact that it has had on cell biology and genetic engineering
EWidder_2010Z-0044286-0045281 this is another one of my favorite fish this is a viperfish and it's got a lure on the end of a long fishing rod that it arches in front of the toothy jaw that gives the viperfish its name
EWidder_2010Z-0056134-0056963 he has no lure for attracting food and no teeth for eating it when it gets there his only hope for existence on this planet is as a gigolo
EWidder_2010Z-0067209-0067749 to me what's shocking is not just the amount of light but the fact that it's not just luciferin and luciferates
EWidder_2010Z-0081345-0082560 you can't use infrared in the sea we used far red light but even that's a problem because it gets absorbed so quickly made an intensified camera wanted to make this electronic jellyfish thing is in science
EWidder_2010Z-0096033-0096767 this is a squid over six feet long that is so new to science it cannot be placed in any known scientific family
EamesDemetrios_2007-0012536-0012702 but people live on this land
EamesDemetrios_2007-0023916-0024865 work better and you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs some of them are kind of cool looking it's like hey why didn't they try that it was that hands on iterative process which is so much like
EamesDemetrios_2007-0041124-0042018 the first version of powers of ten upper left the familiar one on the lower right the eames film tops lower left
EamesDemetrios_2007-0054426-0054524 lucia angel
EamesDemetrios_2007-0070289-0070545 so let's watch that nobody's ever seen it
EamesDemetrios_2007-0083976-0084889 banana leaf parable sort of got to get working there because i'm not prepared to say that the banana leaf that one
EbenBayer_2010G-0013682-0013972 you'll find it inside of you
EbenBayer_2010G-0030502-0031310 then you actually grow the mycelium through these particles and that's where the magic happens because the organism is doing the work in this process not the equipment
EbenBayer_2010G-0040526-0041350 a typical growth cycle for us and condensed it into a fifteen second time lapse and i want you to really watch closely these little white dots on the screen
EbenBayer_2010G-0052225-0053026 what i want to guarantee is that in ten thousand years our descendants our children's children will be living happily and in harmony
EdBoyden_2011-0014543-0015721 and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies if we could activate cells we could see what powers they can unleash what they can initiate and sustain if we could turn them off
EdBoyden_2011-0036978-0037259 it contains little proteins
EdBoyden_2011-0050575-0051575 both at the scientific clinical and pre clinical levels one of the questions we've confronted is what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward because if you could find those
EdBoyden_2011-0072799-0073888 that brain for a brief amount of time until the seizure dies away and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable state
EdBoyden_2011-0086369-0088245 now how could you repair this it's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored because there's nothing for the drug to bind to on the other hand light can still get into the eye the eye is still transparent and you can get light in so what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules and install them on some of these other spare cells and convert them into little cameras
EdBoyden_2011-0101247-0101610 some of the stuff is a little dense
EdGavagan_2012P-0014580-0014956 case and a laptop bag and the tweed jacket with the leather patches
EdGavagan_2012P-0028822-0029714 and i got one straight right punch and knocked the middle guy out the other guy was still working on me collapsing my other lung
EdGavagan_2012P-0043592-0044668 and he later told me one of the last things he did while he was in there was to remove my appendix for me which i thought was great you know just a little tidy thing there at the end
EdGavagan_2012P-0063788-0065400 and then i hear bing bong and the subway doors are closing and my stop is next and i look at these kids and i go i think to myself i'm going to lift my shirt up and
EdUlbrich_2009-0009008-0009050 along with
EdUlbrich_2009-0022285-0022985 so we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of benjamin at the different increments of his life
EdUlbrich_2009-0039486-0040193 a character that could hold up under really all conditions he needed to be able to walk in broad daylight at nighttime under candlelight
EdUlbrich_2009-0056388-0057215 these transcend age race culture gender so this became the foundation of our research as we went forward and then we came across some remarkable technology
EdUlbrich_2009-0067441-0068772 rick baker and rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry and we also brought in a gentleman named kazu tsuji and kazu tsuji is one of the great photoreal sculptors of our time and we commissioned them to make a maquette
EdUlbrich_2009-0075313-0076503 of brad at forty four onto brad at eighty seven so now we had a three d database of everything brad pitt's face can do at age eighty seven in his seventies and in his sixties next we had to go into the shooting process so
EdUlbrich_2009-0083223-0084276 and so what's interesting about this is we used something called image analysis which is taking timings from different components of benjamin's face and so we could choose say his left eyebrow and the software would tell us that well
EdUlbrich_2009-0099006-0099869 or enhance his performance there was something that we encountered though that we ended up calling the digital botox effect so as things went through this process
EddiReaderWHATYOUDO_2004-0008045-0008073 you
EddieObeng_2012G-0026220-0026848 this was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the queen of england when she asked the question
EddieObeng_2012G-0047820-0048475 and then as he turns it ever so slightly more the whole of that green line disappears and instead there are these
EddieObeng_2012G-0068712-0069365 so what i want to leave you then is with the explanation of why i actually traveled sixty thousand miles from my desk
EdiRama_2012X-0011380-0011618 when we painted the first building
EdiRama_2012X-0024667-0024867 deep for years
EdiRama_2012X-0029533-0029752 thirty seven said no we don't like
EdiRama_2012X-0044650-0045046 for each other and for our country
EdiRama_2012X-0053330-0053548 they did not understand me
EdiRama_2012X-0064417-0064579 we removed the kiosks
EdiRama_2012X-0076072-0077131 all politicians today seem the same and politics has come to resemble a sport
EdithWidder_2010Z-0005032-0005681 we trained in a tank in port hueneme and then my first open ocean dive was in santa barbara channel
EdithWidder_2010Z-0013446-0013772 this makes for some pretty spectacular light shows
EdithWidder_2010Z-0035648-0037095 well for animals that are trying to avoid predators by staying in the darkness light can still be very useful for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive and that's find food attract a mate and avoid
EdithWidder_2010Z-0046886-0048504 that lure it's got a built in flashlight it's got these jewel like light organs on its belly that it uses for a type of camouflage that obliterates its shadow so when it's swimming around and there's a predator looking up from below it makes itself disappear
EdithWidder_2010Z-0057525-0057704 so this little guy
EdithWidder_2010Z-0065859-0066017 we were able to bring these animals
EdithWidder_2010Z-0079591-0081327 so i've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore and so sometime ago i got this idea for a camera system it's not exactly rocket science we call this thing eye in the sea and scientists have done this on land for years we just use a color that the animals can't see and then a camera that can see that color
EdithWidder_2010Z-0097813-0099113 which has involved developing the world's first deep sea webcam which has been installed in the monterey canyon for the past year and now more recently a modular form of this system a much more mobile form
EdithWidder_2011-0003345-0003942 that most of the animals in our ocean make light
EdithWidder_2011-0027305-0027508 attention it's phenomenal
EdithWidder_2011-0041110-0041862 there are starfish that can make light and there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms
EdithWidder_2011-0066967-0067881 and then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more and thinks maybe if i come in from a different angle
EdithWidder_2013-0010092-0011225 it was mike that got me invited to the squid summit a gathering of squid experts at the discovery channel that summer during shark week
EdithWidder_2013-0038991-0040668 now what you're seeing is the intensified camera's view under red light and that's all dr kubodera could see when the giant comes in here and then he got so excited he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better
EduardoPaes_2012-0020893-0021753 this is going to be the third largest park in rio by june this year it's going to be a place where people can meet where you can put nature
EduardoPaes_2012-0037260-0038938 all over the world but the point we want to make here tonight is favelas are not always a problem i mean favelas can sometimes really be a solution if you deal with them if you put public policy inside the favelas
EduardoPaes_2012-0054294-0055937 but the reason i could come here is because of that this was something we did with ibm that's a little bit more than a year old it's what we call the operations center of rio and i wanted to show that i can govern my city using technology from here from long beach
EdwardBurtynsky_2005-0008164-0008927 really bring in a sense of that geological time that this has gone on
EdwardBurtynsky_2005-0024904-0025933 we're not seeing there and it's a scary thing as well because when we start looking at the collective appetite for our lifestyles and what we're doing to that landscape
EdwardBurtynsky_2005-0044314-0045050 here you're looking at some oil fields in california some of the biggest oil fields and again i started to think that
EdwardBurtynsky_2005-0055428-0056241 and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships this is a before and after so that was before and this is like ten weeks later
EdwardBurtynsky_2005-0061375-0062654 china because i think on the table right now there's twenty seven nuclear power stations to be built there hasn't been one built in north america for twenty years because of the nimby problem not in my backyard but in china they're saying no we're putting in twenty seven in the next ten years
EdwardBurtynsky_2005-0068560-0069444 here is a sign that translated says obey the birth control law build our science civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth so
EdwardBurtynsky_2005-0080457-0081630 that's building there shanghai i'm looking at the urban renewal in shanghai and this is a whole area that will be flattened and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years
EdwardBurtynsky_2005-0094009-0095146 for most of the big cities beijing and shanghai shenzhen and this isn't even the domestic car market this is the taxi market
EdwardBurtynsky_2005-0106473-0107144 and the sixth one's coming in here so they're building very large blast furnaces
EdwardBurtynsky_2005-0119788-0120951 it took me five fake tries because they were just going to slow them down was literally impossible they were just wound up doing these things all day long until the manager had to with a stern voice
EdwardBurtynsky_2005-0133006-0133535 a textile where they're doing shirts youngor the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in china
EdwardBurtynsky_2005-0144674-0145491 here's another operation it's all cottage industries so it's not big places it's all in people's front porches in
EdwardBurtynsky_2005-0157509-0158200 has been the core behind most of my thinking in my work and also for this incredible
EdwardBurtynsky_2005-0170991-0171754 can be placed into any kind of media they could be posted through the web they could be used as a
EdwardBurtynsky_2005-0182769-0183423 my wife and i we say age seven is the age of reason so they're into the age of reason and they're pre puberty so
EdwardBurtynsky_2005-0194674-0195709 in a very positive way and starts to teach them they know about recycling now but they don't really i think get sustainability in all the things and the energy footprint and how that matters
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G-0001663-0001819 journey thirty years ago
EdwardBurtynsky_2009G-0016312-0017410 and together they only form about fifteen years of supply the whole world at one point two trillion estimated reserves only gives us about forty five years so it's not a question of if it's a question of when
EdwardTenner_2011-0007206-0008831 they wouldn't have really understood it they were responding to immediate concerns they were making it possible for us to do what they do and yet they didn't really understand how they did it now let's advance
EdwardTenner_2011-0023916-0024415 repeatedly according to recent studies show how important it is not to do harm
EdwardTenner_2011-0038627-0040309 fall apart even when judged by the most expert people now there is something else though in the early twentieth century that made things even more complicated and that was that safety technology itself could be a source of danger the lesson of the titanic for a lot of the contemporaries
EdwardTenner_2011-0045512-0047272 so the twentieth century then saw how much more complex reality was but it also saw a positive side it saw that invention could actually benefit from emergencies it could benefit from tragedies
EdwardTenner_2011-0056200-0057288 and my favorite example of that occurred beginning in one thousand nine hundred and seventy six when it was discovered that the bacteria causing legionnaires disease
EdwardTenner_2011-0072991-0073579 story can reflect something of it it was the origin of the xerox copier which
EdwardTenner_2011-0088789-0089975 this means that we need to take a different view of unintended consequences we need to take a really positive view we need to see what they can do for us we need to learn
EinsteinTheParrot_2006-0005428-0005543 which can get pretty dusty
EinsteinTheParrot_2006-0016213-0016679 maybe sirena huang would like to learn some arias on her violin and einstein can sing along
EinsteinTheParrot_2006-0030395-0030420 what
ElaineMorgan_2009G-0012411-0013059 our legs to peer over the tall grass or to chase after animals or to free our hands for weapons
ElaineMorgan_2009G-0023627-0024514 constructing fanciful things on top of it relying on it to be as solid as a rock and now it's whipped away from under you what do you do
ElaineMorgan_2009G-0038239-0039319 of science well i don't think that i think that hardy had a lot going for him i'd like to talk about just a handful of what have been called the
ElaineMorgan_2009G-0052803-0053588 do you think that's significant david attenborough thinks it's significant as the possible beginning of our bipedalism
ElaineMorgan_2009G-0065153-0066444 trying to suggest that for forty odd years this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe and it is not lunatic fringe and the ironic thing about it is
ElaineMorgan_2009G-0078715-0080150 we've got to look to the future ultimately one of three things is going to happen either they will go on for the next forty years fifty years sixty years yeah well we don't talk about that let's talk about something interesting
ElaineMorgan_2009G-0094136-0094350 quite where this diktat
EleanorLongden_2013-0010895-0011842 it was neutral impassive and even after a while strangely companionate and reassuring although i did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped
EleanorLongden_2013-0032404-0033322 by now i had the whole frenzied repertoire terrifying voices grotesque visions bizarre intractable delusions
EleanorLongden_2013-0046963-0047662 now at first this was very difficult to believe not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing
EleanorLongden_2013-0055872-0057560 throughout all of this what i would ultimately realize was that each voice was closely related to aspects of myself and that each of them carried overwhelming emotions that i'd never had an opportunity to process or resolve memories of sexual trauma and abuse of anger shame guilt low self worth
EleanorLongden_2013-0070768-0071299 but a complex significant and meaningful experience to be explored
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G-0002833-0004042 and why not after all happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few but a fundamental human right for all and what is happiness happiness is the freedom of choice
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G-0017971-0019398 just after the harvest because he has no choice she comes back to the market some months later when prices are highest in what we call the lean season when food is scarce because she has to feed her family and has no choice
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G-0032155-0033290 and it seems to me that the reforms might have thrown the baby out with the bath water like its agriculture africa's markets are highly under capitalized and inefficient
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G-0048627-0049425 there is simply no place in the world that has grown it's agriculture on the kind of risk that our farmers in africa today face
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G-0065273-0066450 i decided to leave my comfortable job as a world bank senior economist in washington and come back to my country of birth ethiopia after nearly thirty years abroad i did so for a simple reason
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G-0083316-0084663 you see that the share of western exchanges and this is the u s share of exchanges in the world has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade similarly there's been explosive growth
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G-0098528-0099459 and actually without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things simply see the trading that's happening on the addis ababa trading floor
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G-0111024-0111722 from doing simple back to back limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move
EleniGabreMadhin_2007G-0117946-0118780 and we feel that over the next five years if ethiopia can capture even forty percent just forty percent of the domestic market
EliBeer_2013P-0006836-0007069 we were so scared and we just ran away
EliBeer_2013P-0011584-0011831 a doctor comes in from a block away
EliBeer_2013P-0027900-0028060 when the ambulance arrived
EliBeer_2013P-0042381-0043823 they never get stuck in traffic they could even go on a sidewalk they never literally get stuck in traffic that's why we get there so fast a few years after i started this organization in a jewish community two muslims from east jerusalem called me up
EliBeer_2013P-0056012-0056612 and i'm actually starting it in india very soon with a friend who i met in harvard just a while back
EliPariser_2011-0006028-0006260 in how information is flowing online
EliPariser_2011-0015521-0016980 and you know the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see you can't see how different your search results are from anyone else's but a couple of weeks ago i asked a bunch of friends to google egypt and to send me screen shots of what they got
EliPariser_2011-0021675-0022550 huffington post the washington post the new york times all flirting with personalization in various ways and this moves us very quickly
EliPariser_2011-0025611-0026327 and your filter bubble is your own personal unique universe of information that you live in online
EliPariser_2011-0032204-0032514 we want to watch ace ventura for the fourth time
EliPariser_2011-0041432-0041811 we need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable
EliPariser_2011-0049028-0049718 we need you to make sure that they're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters
ElifShafak_2010G-0008197-0009014 on the other hand was my grandmother who also took care of me and was more spiritual less educated and definitely less rational
ElifShafak_2010G-0023077-0024130 the rich and the poor east and west alike we tend to form clusters based on similarity and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people
ElifShafak_2010G-0034914-0035576 yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan egalitarian classroom democracy
ElifShafak_2010G-0048307-0049623 a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk in the face of death and destruction our mundane differences evaporated and we all became one even if for a few hours
ElifShafak_2010G-0062898-0063974 recently i've also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story and this is a subject that i would love to think about together
ElifShafak_2010G-0076715-0078067 when identity politics tries to put labels on us it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger there's a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the western world are lumped together
ElifShafak_2010G-0090374-0091218 one draws boundaries the other recognizes no frontiers identity politics is made of solid bricks fiction is flowing water
ElifShafak_2010G-0105522-0106941 i'm intrigued by this concept we usually distrust those areas that fall in between things we see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness
ElizabethLesser_2010W-0006945-0007617 and think is a full and accurate picture of reality so looking for answers
ElizabethLesser_2010W-0013013-0013774 and those colored globs are microbes that are actually swimming around in this room right now all around us
ElizabethLesser_2010W-0023189-0024150 then mother teresa another mystic warrior who said the problem with the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small
ElizabethLesser_2010W-0030945-0031381 now here's a title that may sound familiar but whose author may surprise you
ElizabethLesser_2010W-0035052-0035303 all of us myself included to counteract
ElizabethLesser_2010W-0038775-0040005 i suggest you start more local because there is no shortage of the other right in your own neighborhood maybe that person who worships at the mosque
ElizabethLesser_2010W-0048135-0048765 from there we dove in and we used these questions share some of your life experiences with me
ElizabethLesser_2010W-0057507-0058204 but we also hadn't pretended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lunch
ElizabethLindsey_2010W-0002127-0002577 three old women who took care of me while my parents worked
ElizabethLindsey_2010W-0009003-0009175 they begin to chant
ElizabethLindsey_2010W-0019238-0019455 the year is two thousand and seven
ElizabethLindsey_2010W-0028681-0029060 it's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old
ElizabethLindsey_2010W-0037285-0037450 their canoes
ElizabethLindsey_2010W-0045590-0046190 this i know intimately because even as i travel throughout the world
ElizabethLindsey_2010W-0054722-0055129 that we continue to find our way and this is what he said
ElizabethLoftus_2013G-0003229-0004373 and one night the couple went out for a romantic restaurant meal they were on their way home and they were pulled over by a police officer you see titus car
ElizabethLoftus_2013G-0013232-0015108 and really that's where this case should have ended it should have been over titus should have thought of this as a horrible year a year of accusation and trial but over it didn't end that way titus was so bitter he'd lost his job he couldn't get it back
ElizabethLoftus_2013G-0028506-0029549 and when those cases have been analyzed three quarters of them are due to faulty memory faulty eyewitness memory
ElizabethLoftus_2013G-0043261-0044976 who were undergoing a harrowing training exercise to teach them what it's going to be like for them if they are ever captured as prisoners of war and as part of this training exercise these soldiers are interrogated in an aggressive
ElizabethLoftus_2013G-0057110-0058607 and when i began looking into these cases i was wondering where do these bizarre memories come from and what i found is that most of these situations involved some particular form
ElizabethLoftus_2013G-0072015-0072882 that have made the decision that the temporary discomfort that some of these subjects might experience in these studies
ElizabethLoftus_2013G-0078303-0079748 that was being claimed by her grown daughter she accused her mother of sexual abuse based on a repressed memory and this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story to be filmed and presented in public places
ElizabethLoftus_2013G-0090225-0091187 well along with this ability to plant memories and control behavior obviously come some important ethical issues
ElizabethMurchison_2011G-0001830-0003414 but we don't normally think of cancer as being a contagious disease the tasmanian devil has shown us that not only can cancer be a contagious disease but it can also threaten an entire species
ElizabethMurchison_2011G-0014566-0015847 animals just like humans sometimes get strange tumors however we now believe that this is the first sighting of a new disease which is now an epidemic spreading through tasmania
ElizabethMurchison_2011G-0029087-0029662 cancer is a disease that affects millions of people around the world every year
ElizabethMurchison_2011G-0045021-0045259 in fact jonas and his tumor
ElizabethMurchison_2011G-0064262-0064887 this cancer is remarkable it's the oldest mammalian derived life form that we know of
ElizabethMurchison_2011G-0074858-0076355 in fact i believe given more knowledge of the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer's growth we can defeat cancer my personal aim is to defeat the tasmanian devil cancer
ElizabethPisani_2010-0014347-0015306 and i can see the needle coming down towards me and there is blood all over the place it's getting blunter and blunter and a small part of my brain is thinking
ElizabethPisani_2010-0024549-0025329 that if they share they're going to get hiv but they're all sharing anyway so what's that about is it like you get a better high if you share or something we asked that to
ElizabethPisani_2010-0034338-0035455 and she put in the world's first national needle exchange program and other countries followed suit australia the netherlands and few others and in all of those countries you can see not more than four percent
ElizabethPisani_2010-0044799-0045426 so completely irrational you would think except that wait a minute politicians are rational
ElizabethPisani_2010-0060804-0061603 and they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy
ElizabethPisani_2010-0075222-0076246 now funnily enough this is also joseph after six months on antiretroviral treatment not for nothing do we call it the lazarus effect
ElizabethPisani_2010-0086803-0087374 so i'm pretty safe and the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of
ElizabethPisani_2010-0098944-0099742 i want to give what's very nearly the last word to ines ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of jakarta she's a chick
EllenDunhamJones_2010X-0010742-0012266 mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more and living in detached buildings you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of so strictly from a climate change perspective
EllenDunhamJones_2010X-0017321-0018460 and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one in three chance of developing diabetes
EllenDunhamJones_2010X-0023291-0024199 about half of households make between twenty thousand and fifty thousand a year and they are spending twenty nine percent of their income on housing
EllenDunhamJones_2010X-0041375-0041779 and they now have a relatively central location
EllenDunhamJones_2010X-0051882-0053108 this one is a little l shaped strip shopping center in phoenix arizona really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint a gourmet grocery and they put up a restaurant in the old post office
EllenDunhamJones_2010X-0063922-0064575 this is another infill project on the parking lots this one of an office park outside of washington d c
EllenDunhamJones_2010X-0082754-0083765 you want to also try to get more systemic transformation we need to also retrofit the corridors themselves so this is one that has been retrofitted in california
EllenDunhamJones_2010X-0094103-0094921 the creek had been culverted under the parking lot but daylighting our creeks really improves their water quality and contributions to habitat
EllenDunhamJones_2010X-0103165-0104093 is to improve the architectural design quality of the retrofits and i close with this image of democracy in action
EllenGustafson_2010X-0002599-0003238 and i got from global security policy to food because i realized when i'm hungry i'm really pissed off and i'm assuming the rest of the world is
EllenGustafson_2010X-0022254-0023116 fallen precipitously as hunger has risen so somehow we're not making the connect between exporting a good agricultural system that will help feed people all around the world
EllenGustafson_2010X-0038935-0039944 the farm crisis in america and the change in how we've addressed agriculture internationally so there's a lot of reasons to take this thirty year time period as sort of the creation of this new food system
EllenGustafson_2010X-0053638-0054525 then maybe it's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three quarters of the products being made from corn soy and wheat
EllenJorgensen_2012G-0016750-0017446 for the next six months when you googled my name instead of getting my scientific papers you got this
EllenJorgensen_2012G-0033393-0034739 as a matter of fact diy people from all over the world america europe got together last year and we hammered out a common code of ethics that's a lot more than conventional science has done now
EllenJorgensen_2012G-0046857-0047118 he threw tennis balls to all the neighborhood dogs
EllenTHoen_2012X-0008341-0008694 what has this got to do
EllenTHoen_2012X-0024796-0025354 today eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs
EllenTHoen_2012X-0028631-0028997 things have changed first of all the rules have changed
EllenTHoen_2012X-0033404-0035006 and unless we do something now we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis because new drugs are developed new drugs go to market but these medicines are patented in a much wider range of countries
EllenTHoen_2012X-0046623-0047360 over the sales to the patent holders so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property
EllenTHoen_2012X-0060250-0061801 nelson's expectations are very high and quite rightly so he and his son will need access to the next generation of antiretrovirals and the next throughout their lifetime so that he
ElliotKrane_2011U-0008507-0008955 now i want you to imagine that i'm stroking it with this please
ElliotKrane_2011U-0020228-0021658 how can the nervous system get this so wrong how can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame
ElliotKrane_2011U-0037323-0037697 we take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet
ElliotKrane_2011U-0048043-0048350 thank you very much
ElonMusk_2013-0036470-0037793 and so this is something that maybe a lot of people don't realize we actually have california and nevada covered and we've got the eastern seaboard from boston to d c covered by the end of this year you'll be able to drive from l a to new york
ElonMusk_2013-0079901-0080302 the future to be an exciting and inspiring one
ElynSaks_2012G-0001256-0002445 i'm a woman with chronic schizophrenia i've spent hundreds of days in psychiatric hospitals i might have ended up spending most of my life on the back ward of a hospital but that isn't how my life turned out
ElynSaks_2012G-0015879-0016094 he's definitely the star of my show
ElynSaks_2012G-0026516-0027219 so the following episode happened the seventh week of my first semester of my first year at yale law school quoting from my writings
ElynSaks_2012G-0044409-0046401 during the next year i would spend five months in a psychiatric hospital at times i spent up to twenty hours in mechanical restraints arms tied arms and legs tied down arms and legs tied down with a net tied tightly across my chest i never struck anyone i never harmed anyone i never made any direct threats
ElynSaks_2012G-0062239-0062741 head explosions and people trying to kill is it okay if i totally trash your office
ElynSaks_2012G-0086185-0086920 what those of us who suffer with mental illness want is what everybody wants in the words of sigmund freud to work and to love thank you
EmilyLevine_2002-0013904-0014368 use big words learn the lingua franca
EmilyLevine_2002-0024736-0025565 well rationality is constructed by what christie hefner was talking about today that mind body split you know the head is
EmilyLevine_2002-0030088-0030792 yes but it's also the head the head of the conference that's the other way that humor like art buchwald
EmilyLevine_2002-0045927-0046741 passive no voice i was so fascinated by that oxygen commercial i don't know if you know this but
EmilyLevine_2002-0054676-0055216 why frankly i believe in political correctness i do i think it can go too far i think
EmilyLevine_2002-0065435-0066787 in this way i read a book by a woman named amy richlin who is the chair of the classics department at usc and the book is called the garden of priapus and she says that roman humor
EmilyLevine_2002-0079533-0080368 the world and that's really what i'm looking for and i was sort of as i was starting to analyze what exactly it is that i do
EmilyLevine_2002-0089663-0090377 problem with quote objectivity unquote when you're only surrounded by people who speak the same vocabulary as you
EmilyLevine_2002-0103808-0104545 the ability to hold his ideas lightly so that he can let room in for new
EmilyLevine_2002-0113783-0114999 and now we're being penetrated you know the biotech companies are actually going inside us and planting their little flags on our genes you know we're being penetrated and i suspect by someone who actively dislikes
EmilyLevine_2002-0127720-0129025 the accidents to happen i was thinking about what moshe safdie said yesterday about beauty because in his book hyde says that
EmilyOster_2007-0006526-0007514 and decrease the epidemic so today i'm going to talk about some things that you might not know about the epidemic and then actually i'm also going to challenge some of these things that you think that you do
EmilyOster_2007-0020020-0020102 this seems puzzling
EmilyOster_2007-0034989-0035170 and they respond less to this existing
EmilyOster_2007-0054820-0054958 what hiv prevalence was in the
EmilyOster_2007-0074457-0075410 where trade is likely to change for example because of the african growth and opportunities act or other policies that encourage trade we can actually think about which areas are likely to be
EmilyPilloton_2010G-0004817-0005807 the entire county is home to just twenty thousand people and they're very sparsely distributed so there's only twenty seven people per square mile which comes down to about ten people per square kilometer
EmilyPilloton_2010G-0019093-0019862 and only eight percent of the people in the county have a bachelor's degree or higher so there isn't a big legacy in the pride of education
EmilyPilloton_2010G-0025401-0026100 to come come to bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district
EmilyPilloton_2010G-0033936-0035119 there's space to experiment and to weld and to test things we have an amazing advocate in doctor zullinger there's a nobility of real hands on dirt under your fingernails work
EmilyPilloton_2010G-0050170-0051081 and in match me you take the class divide it into two teams one team on each side of the playground and the teacher will take piece of chalk and just write a number on each of the tires
EmilyPilloton_2010G-0064972-0065828 so the first batch of computers are being installed later this summer and we're helping doctor zullinger develop some strategies around how we might connect the classroom
EmilyPilloton_2010G-0085522-0086237 this is eric he plays for the football team he is really into dirtbike racing and he wants to be an architect
EmmaTeeling_2012X-0005404-0006783 and the third really intriguing aspect of this mammal is that i fully believe that the secret of everlasting youth lies deep within its dna
EmmaTeeling_2012X-0038689-0038927 and why is this
EmmaTeeling_2012X-0059871-0060134 in many mammals that have been
EmmaTeeling_2012X-0087178-0087951 there are nineteen species of mammal that live longer than expected given their body size than man and eighteen of those
EmmanuelJal_2009G-0006297-0007390 who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice because he can't write or there is no internet like facebook myspace youtube for them to
EmmanuelJal_2009G-0020035-0020988 and using religion to get what they want to get out of us which is the oil the diamond the gold and the land
EmmanuelJal_2009G-0030098-0030802 i knew it was rude but was needed food and therefore i was forced to sin forced to
EmmanuelJal_2009G-0041308-0042411 question what am i here for and why are my people poor and why why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write i was learning how to fight
EmmanuelJal_2009G-0058129-0059038 it's a normal thing in my home people eat one meal a day here i am in the west i choose not to so in my village now kids
EmmanuelJal_2009G-0069959-0070967 all those old men that are creating wars in africa they will die soon but if you invest in education then we'll be able to change africa that's what i'm asking
EnricSala_2010Z-0001647-0001932 tell you two things today one is what we have lost and
EnricSala_2010Z-0010159-0010877 so i'm going to get us all on a time machine and we're going to the left we're going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like
EnricSala_2010Z-0018198-0018894 the corals are doing better and there are sharks you can see sharks in every single dive and this is something that is very unusual in today's coral reefs
EnricSala_2010Z-0024380-0024939 but this is a consequence this view of the world is a consequence of having studied degraded reefs
EnricSala_2010Z-0033614-0034196 in christmas where the food web is really trimmed down where the large animals are gone the corals have
EnricSala_2010Z-0042251-0042662 and at the same time i was watching jacques cousteau's shows on tv
EnricSala_2010Z-0054319-0055090 egg cases laid by a snail off the coast of chile and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom outside the reserve
EnricSala_2010Z-0064216-0065615 degrading fishing gear seine nets were removed the fishermen were catching more if you fish less you're actually catching more but if we add the no take reserve on top of that the fishermen are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected
EnricSala_2010Z-0077163-0078349 many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices well there are a couple estimates of how much if would cost to create a network of protected areas covering twenty percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction
EnricSala_2010Z-0090238-0091238 so the solutions are fixing these three issues first we need to develop a global awareness companion to inspire local communities and governments
EnricSala_2010Z-0101422-0102041 that seems impossible how could eighty five percent survive on fifteen percent
EnricSala_2010Z-0108226-0108917 so the numbers you presented really are astonishing you're saying we're spending thirty five billion dollars now on subsidies
EnricSala_2010Z-0115796-0116990 the best feeling is this biophilia that e o wilson talks about where humans have this sense of awe and wonder in front of untamed nature of raw nature and there only there you
ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X-0023649-0023939 so although that would be really really awesome again that
ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X-0056691-0057889 the normal trajectory of a famous person he gets more and more and more famous except if you look in german if you look in german you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never see
EricBerlow_2010G-0003747-0004980 i'm an ecologist and i study complexity i love complexity and i study that in the natural world the interconnectedness of species so here's a food web or a map of feeding links between species that live in alpine lakes in the mountains of california
EricBerlow_2010G-0019863-0021238 because simple answers may emerge we're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies on the other side of complexity so for any problem the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity the better chance you have of zooming in on the simple details that matter most thank you
EricBerlow_2013U-0014428-0016004 and what we did on this is we analyzed the top twenty five percent of these and we started to see where the connections occurred where they connected with each other cameron russell talking about image and beauty connected over into europe we've got a bigger conversation about israel and palestine radiating outwards from the middle east
EricBerlow_2013U-0035676-0036280 well here's one by jessica green about the microbial ecology of buildings it's literally defining a new field
EricDishman_2009P-0003474-0004128 if you think about the phone right it's something that we can use for some incredible ways to help people actually take the right medication at the right time
EricDishman_2009P-0009899-0010977 very big differences between the way i answered the phone the three times and as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time down to the tenths of a
EricDishman_2009P-0018371-0019307 and then wow what a radical idea we except in the united states might be able to use this newfangled technology to actually interact with a nurse
EricDishman_2009P-0033028-0034021 but nobody is home on this demographic y two k plus ten problem right i mean we sort of get it here but we don't get it here and we're not doing anything about it
EricDishman_2009P-0049961-0050806 we are obsessed with this way of thinking when intel does surveys all around the world and we say quick response healthcare the first word that comes up is doctor
EricDishman_2009P-0064166-0064788 broke her pelvis lay all night all morning finally somebody came in and found her sent her to the hospital
EricDishman_2009P-0078142-0079201 are game changing and like the discovery of the microscope because of our collecting data streams that we've actually never done before this is an example in our trill clinic in ireland of actually what you're seeing is she's looking at data
EricDishman_2009P-0093183-0094079 and treating the home and the patient and the family member and the caregivers as part of these coordinated care teams and using disruptive technologies that are already here
EricDishman_2013S-0010266-0010511 and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these
EricDishman_2013S-0026320-0026527 okay
EricDishman_2013S-0045602-0047478 now the software is also getting smarter right think about a coach an agent online that's going to help me do safe self care that same interaction that we just did with the ultrasound will likely have real time image processing and the device will say up down left right ah eric that's the perfect spot to send that image off to your doctor
EricDishman_2013S-0062616-0063562 as well as have an exchange network online where for example i can donate three hours of care a day to your mom if somebody else can help me with transportation to meals and we exchange
EricDishman_2013S-0075399-0076977 now the second example of customization and by the way you can't customize care if you don't know your own goals so health care can't know those until you know your own health care goals but the second example i want to give you is i happened to be an early guinea pig and i got very lucky to have my whole genome sequenced now it took about
EricDishman_2013S-0092204-0094156 artificial kidneys even printable kidneys that are coming but until such time that these amazing technologies are available to all of us and even when they are it's up to us to care for and even save one another i hope you will go out and make personal health happen for yourselves and for everyone thanks so much
EricGiler_2009G-0013394-0014059 to supply battery power to something is on the order of two to three hundred pounds think about that
EricGiler_2009G-0026113-0026906 that coil to resonate what will happen is it will pulse at alternating current frequencies at a fairly high frequency by the way
EricGiler_2009G-0044238-0044352 so
EricSanderson_2009G-0002847-0003754 to try and see our true selves or perhaps pass through to another world or in the words of f scott fitzgerald
EricSanderson_2009G-0013407-0014163 go to times square and i'd look at the amazing ladies on the wall and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them
EricSanderson_2009G-0022566-0023688 you can see the extent of new york city as it was right at the end of the american revolution here's bowling green and here's broadway and this is city hall park so the city basically extended to city hall park
EricSanderson_2009G-0036628-0037579 to the hills to the streams to the basic hydrology and shoreline to the beaches the basic aspects that make the ecological landscape
EricSanderson_2009G-0051645-0052429 wanted to try and map these and to do that what we did was we mapped their habitat needs where do they get their food where do they get their water
EricSanderson_2009G-0066197-0067021 so then we took the muir webs and we took them back to the maps so if we wanted to go between eighty fifth and eighty sixth and lex and three rd maybe there was a stream in that block
EricSanderson_2009G-0087092-0088442 and a sense of meaning this is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity and so many of the talks here at ted are about meaning about bringing meaning to our lives in all kinds of different ways through technology through art through science
EricTopol_2009P-0006385-0006522 but that's just the beginning
EricTopol_2009P-0021069-0022202 that one could look at in your smartphone now this is an example of another obsolete technology soon to be buried the holter monitor twenty four hour recording lots of wires this is now a little tiny patch
EricTopol_2009P-0032978-0033831 which is eighty percent related to hospitalization and in the course of thirty days after a hospital stay for a medicare greater than sixty five years or older
EricTopol_2009P-0047861-0048732 of course it tells you how many calories you're expending from the exercise and how many you took in if you go in and enter all the foods but it really wants you to enter all your activity
EricTopol_2009P-0062065-0063042 and really interesting stuff look at this thing and say well i didn't think i was a very good sleeper but actually i did better than average in fifty to sixty year
EricTopol_2009P-0076372-0077293 and this article from the economist summed it up beautifully about the opportunities in health across the developing world mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people more quickly
EricTopol_2009P-0090840-0091384 guidance and that's of course relying on the fact that medicine goes digital if we understand biology
EricWhitacre_2011-0006376-0007933 the choir people in my high school were pretty geeky and there was no way i was going to have anything to do with those people and about a week later a friend of mine came to me and said listen you've got to join choir at the end of the semester we're taking a trip to mexico all expenses paid and the soprano section is just full of
EricWhitacre_2011-0023147-0023967 so i wrote on my blog omg omg i actually wrote omg hopefully for the last time in public ever
EricWhitacre_2011-0060677-0062542 from malta madagascar thailand vietnam jordan egypt israel as far north as alaska and as far south as new zealand and we also put a page on facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials what it was like for them their experience singing it
EricWhitacre_2011-0077156-0077535 and
EricWhitacre_2013-0008325-0008796 now fast forward to just three years ago
EricWhitacre_2013-0013878-0015818 and when i was speaking to chris about the future of virtual choir and where we might be able to take this he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could could we do this all in real time could we have people singing together in real time and with the help of skype that is what we are going to attempt today
EricXLi_2013G-0007528-0009307 but before we get there we're engaged in a struggle between good and evil the good of socialism against the evil of capitalism and the good shall triumph that of course was the meta narrative distilled from the theories of karl marx and the chinese bought it
EricXLi_2013G-0026970-0028916 six hundred fifty million people were lifted out of poverty eighty percent of the entire world's poverty alleviation during that period happened in china in other words all the new and old democracies put together amounted to a mere fraction of what a single one party state did without voting
EricXLi_2013G-0041026-0042739 political leaders used to retain their positions for life and they used that to accumulate power and perpetuate their rules mao was the father of modern china yet his prolonged rule led to disastrous mistakes so the party instituted term limits with mandatory retirement age of sixty eight to seventy
EricXLi_2013G-0055508-0056567 it operates a rotating pyramid made up of three components civil service state owned enterprises and social organizations like a university or a community program
EricXLi_2013G-0075942-0077646 and its people live in increasing prosperity pew research polls chinese public attitudes and here are the numbers in recent years satisfaction with the direction of the country eighty five percent those who think they're better off than five years ago seventy percent
EricXLi_2013G-0090771-0091825 now i'm a venture capitalist i make bets it wouldn't be fair to end this talk without putting myself on the line and making some predictions so here they are
EricXLi_2013G-0112535-0112769 not just from the central government
EricaFrenkel_2011X-0007858-0008727 it's a delicate machine running on computer algorithms and it needs special care tlc to keep it up and running and it's going to break pretty easily and when it does
EricaFrenkel_2011X-0023475-0025025 and everything began pretty auspiciously the surgeon was on call and scrubbed in the nurse was there she was able to anesthetize her quickly and it was important because of the emergency nature of the situation and everything began well until the power went out
EricaFrenkel_2011X-0038656-0039464 but so in here when there's electricity the oxygen concentrator takes in room air now we know room air is gloriously free
EricaFrenkel_2011X-0054091-0055854 but we're not content to stop there is it working is this the design that's going to work in place well we've seen good results so far this is in thirteen hospitals in four countries and since two thousand and ten we've done well over two thousand surgeries with no clinically adverse events
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013-0004859-0005906 it fell to the next generation to invent new work processes and then productivity soared often doubling or even tripling in those factories
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013-0012143-0012580 but they are actually the growing pains of what andrew mcafee and i call
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013-0024633-0025680 in total my research estimates that the gdp numbers miss over three hundred billion dollars per year in free goods and services on the internet
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013-0031339-0031638 secondly the new machine age is exponential
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013-0039710-0041071 put them together and we're seeing a wave of astonishing breakthroughs like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah or leap tall buildings in a single bound you know robots are even revolutionizing cat transportation
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013-0045656-0046102 the next day it started answering questions with profanities
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013-0055294-0056133 you know i recently overheard a conversation that epitomizes these new economics this guy says nah i don't use h r block anymore
ErikBrynjolfsson_2013-0063736-0064415 the machine won that day and today a chess program running on a cell phone can beat a human grandmaster
ErikHersman_2009U-0002893-0003663 a year ago in kenya we had post election violence and in that time we prototyped and built in about three days a system that would allow
ErikHersman_2009U-0017693-0018773 so what we built of course ushahidi is crowdsourcing this information you see this with twitter too you get this information overload so you've got a lot of information that's great but now what
ErikJohansson_2011S-0008154-0009225 both dark and colorful but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism when i say realism i mean photo realism because of course
ErikJohansson_2011S-0019665-0020027 i think it's the things that we don't even think about the things
ErikJohansson_2011S-0025788-0026301 by matching color contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images
ErikJohansson_2011S-0033945-0034131 it always starts with a sketch
ErikSchlangen_2012X-0025945-0027352 induction can heat especially steel it's very good at that then what you do is you heat up the steel you melt the bitumen and the bitumen will flow into these micro cracks and the stones are again fixed to the surface
ErinMcKean_2007-0002133-0002914 how about this word here i'll show it to you lexicography the practice of compiling dictionaries notice we're very specific that word compile
ErinMcKean_2007-0013882-0014009 fishing well
ErinMcKean_2007-0034663-0035144 it's more likely to be a bad dictionary why are you blaming the ham for being too big
ErinMcKean_2007-0049187-0049631 just the right tool for the job and so people say to me how do i know if a word is
ErinMcKean_2007-0064291-0064401 if you think of the word
ErinMcKean_2007-0081980-0082695 is like an archaeological artifact if you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact it's not science
ErinMcKean_2007-0093573-0094161 time fishing and i don't have to be a traffic cop anymore thank you very much for your kind

EstherDuflo_2010-0013928-0014507 do you focus on your everyday life and let the earthquake every eight days continue to happen
EstherDuflo_2010-0033133-0034026 and in this way you can take the guesswork out of policy making by knowing what works what doesn't work and why
EstherDuflo_2010-0052434-0053639 should you give them for free or should you ask people to pay for them so the answer hinges on the answer to three simple questions one is if people must pay for a bed net are they going to purchase them
EstherDuflo_2010-0064878-0065254 nets so you will think that's great you know how to immunize you know how to give bed nets
EstherDuflo_2010-0071734-0071869 so why shouldn't we do the same with
EstherDuflo_2010-0078517-0079144 the kids of their worms and for every hundred dollars you get almost thirty extra years of education
EstherDuflo_2010-0093338-0093829 in two thousand and nine so this evidence is powerful it can prompt action
EstherPerel_2013S-0004383-0004852 and why does sex make babies and babies spell erotic disaster in couples
EstherPerel_2013S-0027005-0027381 so if there is a verb for me that comes with love it's to have
EstherPerel_2013S-0045255-0046670 i look at this person and i momentarily get a shift in perception and i stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me and then more importantly in this description about the other
EstherPerel_2013S-0059976-0061842 we can hint at it we don't even have to do it we can experience that powerful thing called anticipation which is a mortar to desire the ability to imagine it as if it's happening to experience it as if it's happening while nothing is happening and everything is happening at the same time
EstherPerel_2013S-0081383-0082848 favorites of love jealousy possessiveness aggression power dominance naughtiness mischief basically most of us will get turned on at night by the very same things that we will demonstrate against during the day
EstherPerel_2013S-0104108-0104778 so in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs
EthanZuckerman_2010G-0011071-0011695 has released a new single actually five or six new singles as near as i can tell titled cala a boca galvao
EthanZuckerman_2010G-0025021-0026394 and again that was very shocking to many twitter users but it shouldn't be and the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day you can go into trending topics and you tend to find topics that are almost entirely african american conversations
EthanZuckerman_2010G-0041086-0042422 here's what i think is going on i think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization we look at the framework that makes it possible to live in this connected world and that's a framework that includes things like
EthanZuckerman_2010G-0055316-0056205 when you look at the new york times you look at other elite media what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we've invaded it turns out that new media
EthanZuckerman_2010G-0070071-0071311 and i used to think that a dark spot on this map basically meant you're not going to get media from there because there are more basic needs what i'm starting to realize is that you can get media it's just an enormous amount of work and you need an enormous amount of encouragement
EthanZuckerman_2010G-0083123-0083664 it's the project of a guy named zhang lei who was living in the united states during the lhasa riots
EthanZuckerman_2010G-0094953-0095904 she's a skilled human curator who knows what material is available to her who's able to listen to the audience and who's able to make a selection and push people forward in one fashion or another

EuvinNaidoo_2007G-0054948-0055664 very opportunities so let's start getting into the countries and into the specific material and data
EuvinNaidoo_2007G-0078602-0079295 we had the launch of the east african organic produce standard again

EvaVertes_2005-0007684-0008385 to make a long story short they came to canada my grandmother was a chemist she worked at the banting institute in toronto
EvaVertes_2005-0024030-0024778 so that's what led me into alzheimer's i started reading about alzheimer's and tried to familiarize myself with the research
EvaVertes_2005-0038076-0038905 it seems that cancer is a direct result to injury if you smoke you damage your lung tissue and then
EvaVertes_2005-0051086-0052688 and while i was reading all these articles about cancer it seemed that the articles a lot of them focused on you know the genetics of breast cancer and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer tracking the cancer through the body tracing where it is where it goes
EvaVertes_2005-0070582-0071711 blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels and you think the more highways there are in a tissue the more likely it is to get cancer or to get
EvaVertes_2005-0084904-0086261 so a tumor expresses chemokine receptors and another organ a distant organ somewhere in the body will have the corresponding chemokines and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it
EvaVertes_2005-0095215-0096413 muscle has a factor in it called myod and what myod essentially does is it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells
EvaVertes_2005-0108726-0109608 what if we could in the future use cancer a tumor put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells
EvaZeisel_2001-0012847-0012924 the
EvaZeisel_2001-0020443-0020674 of things they make things
EvaZeisel_2001-0027795-0028117 that we have to
EvaZeisel_2001-0040205-0041119 as an apprentice to a hungarian craftsman and this taught me
EvaZeisel_2001-0054805-0055865 also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights and my working conditions and i still have that
EvaZeisel_2001-0068273-0069236 model maker everybody concerned himself much more with the art department that means with my work than making toilets so
EvaZeisel_2001-0080275-0080412 the first day i came to
EvaZeisel_2001-0093498-0093578 at the beginning of
EvaZeisel_2001-0105259-0106021 today which is not a very pleasant and happy view here i am now if this is the
EvanGrant_2009G-0017591-0018781 we can also use cymatics as a beautiful natural art form this image here is created from a snippet of beethoven's ninth symphony playing through a cymatic device so it kind of flips things on it's head
EvanWilliams_2009-0001885-0001980 four years ago
EvanWilliams_2009-0009197-0010039 so for those of you unfamiliar twitter is based around a very simple
EvanWilliams_2009-0028931-0030370 as well as things like a device that lets an unborn baby twitter when it kicks or a plant twitter when it needs water probably the most important third party development came from a little company in virginia called summize summize built a twitter search engine
EvanWilliams_2009-0041171-0041674 live this is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do after they've been to an event it's
EveEnsler_2004-0004788-0005499 in the first place it's not so easy to even find your vagina women go days weeks months without looking at it
EveEnsler_2004-0016591-0017188 a woman told me there her mother used to tell her don't wear panties dear underneath your pajamas you need to air out your pussy cat
EveEnsler_2004-0029077-0030227 to be honest i remember when i started practicing buddhism fourteen years ago and i was told that the end of this practice was to be happy i said how could you be happy and live in this world of suffering
EveEnsler_2004-0045650-0046712 that one out of every three women on this planet will be beaten or raped in her lifetime that's essentially a gender that's essentially the resource of the planet which is women
EveEnsler_2004-0058364-0059324 we went to a back room and women were seated and a curtain was pulled around us and they were served vanilla ice cream and women lifted their burqas and ate this ice cream
EveEnsler_2004-0065605-0066502 what has also happened is in the course of these travels and it's been an extraordinary thing is that every single place that i have gone to in the world i have met a
EveEnsler_2004-0072980-0073064 experience it
EveEnsler_2004-0083225-0084634 where we sold out the entire testosterone filled dome eighteen thousand people standing up to say yes to vaginas which was really a pretty incredible transformation and she came and she witnessed this and she decided that she would go back and leave her husband
EveEnsler_2004-0097871-0098618 and in the course of her travel she walked literally for eight years through the rift valley through dust through sleeping on the ground because the
EveEnsler_2004-0109823-0110652 i want to tell you a great story when agnes first started fighting to stop female genital mutilation in her community she had become an outcast and she was exiled
EveEnsler_2005G-0001935-0002833 i began the vagina monologues because i was worried about vaginas i'm very worried today about this notion this world this prevailing
EveEnsler_2005G-0014985-0015882 all this striving for security in fact has made you much more insecure because now you have to watch out all the time there are people not like you
EveEnsler_2005G-0029938-0030911 they have a fierceness and a freedom that i believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm they have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator
EveEnsler_2005G-0044463-0045327 so she really struggled with this what to do because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school and she was threatened expulsion so what she did is she got all her friends together
EveEnsler_2005G-0064438-0065190 south africa and i had no idea where i was i didn't know where i was going where i'd come from and i panicked i had a total anxiety attack
EveEnsler_2005G-0078619-0079445 visionaries they are the future if you think that the un now says that one out of three women on the planet will be raped or beaten in their lifetime
EveEnsler_2009I-0015907-0016755 to be a man means not to be a girl to be a woman means not to be a girl to be strong means not to be a girl to be a leader means not to be a girl
EveEnsler_2009I-0030439-0031622 chains and circled and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the west can have it and profit from them my mind was so
EveEnsler_2009I-0044665-0045589 i've traveled as i said to many many countries and i've seen if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously
EveEnsler_2009I-0057067-0058379 i've been talking to girls for five years and one of the things that i've seen is true everywhere is that the verb that's been enforced on girl is the verb to please girls are trained to please i want to change the verb
EveEnsler_2009I-0072860-0073783 in kenya in august i went to visit one of the v day safe houses for girls a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named agnes
EveEnsler_2009I-0086030-0086869 and agnes loved her and agnes supported her for the year and she went to school and she found her voice and she found her identity and she found her heart and then
EveEnsler_2009I-0094157-0094472 i want to close today with a new piece from my book
EveEnsler_2009I-0099387-0099440 this
EveEnsler_2009I-0111408-0111608 wind continues to pollinate
EveEnsler_2010W-0005469-0005932 it was a way of keeping my head attached it was a way of locating myself
EveEnsler_2010W-0017124-0017887 i heard people murmur from time to time that i should love my body so i learned how to do this i was a vegetarian
EveEnsler_2010W-0029777-0029986 i heard about a little girl
EveEnsler_2010W-0038097-0038417 suddenly i had a body
EveEnsler_2010W-0052412-0053887 i know that the abscess that grew around my wound after the operation the sixteen ounces of puss is the contaminated gulf of mexico and there were oil drenched pelicans inside me and dead floating
EveEnsler_2010W-0069589-0069960 in the same way that seventy five percent of the planet
EvelynGlennie_2003-0007481-0008305 my little motorbike bag we have here hopefully a piece of music

EvelynGlennie_2003-0041201-0041915 i think of myself as a technician that is someone who is basically a percussion player
EvelynGlennie_2003-0053416-0054451 it's amazing that when you do open your body up and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through that in fact the tiny tiny difference
EvelynGlennie_2003-0065249-0066061 the art of creating sound then we have to think very very hard about the people you do actually
EvelynGlennie_2003-0077965-0078705 and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba and you play something that's so incredibly organ like
EvelynGlennie_2003-0098205-0099058 that in other halls they're simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore my level of soft gentle playing may have to be
EvelynGlennie_2003-0113394-0114505 if we see someone in a wheelchair we assume they cannot walk it may be that they can walk three four five steps that to them means they can walk
EvelynGlennie_2003-0118944-0119872 it may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music but that doesn't mean i have the right to say it's a bad piece of music
EvelynGlennie_2003-0126877-0127064 you're awake
EvelynGlennie_2003-0139553-0139594 head
EvelynGlennie_2003-0151718-0152482 by saying something through the music and by saying something through music which basically is sound
EvgenyMorozov_2009G-0001340-0002087 good morning i think as a grumpy eastern european i was brought in to play the pessimist this morning so bear with
EvgenyMorozov_2009G-0014238-0015303 put it very simply the assumption so far has been that if you give people enough connectivity if you give them enough devices democracy will inevitably follow
EvgenyMorozov_2009G-0025673-0027058 in order to leave ideological comments and create a lot of ideological blog posts to comment on sensitive political issues right so you may wonder why on earth are they doing it why are they engaging with cyberspace
EvgenyMorozov_2009G-0041705-0042508 think that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships but in many cases it only strengthens them and you may wonder why
EvgenyMorozov_2009G-0058789-0059870 we often hear about cyber activism how people are getting more active because of the internet rarely hear about cyber hedonism for example how people are becoming passive why because they somehow assume

FabianHemmert_2009X-0001919-0002592 and that means i have a question how can we make digital content graspable because you see
FabianHemmert_2009X-0015943-0016833 another thing is sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone they are bigger than the phone itself so in that case like here there's an app that's bigger than the phone's screen
FabianOefner_2013G-0010559-0011664 science is a very rational approach to its surroundings whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings
FabianOefner_2013G-0031082-0031616 let me now turn to another project which involves less harmful substances
FabianOefner_2013G-0049059-0049595 i can assure you i was fully conscious while i was taking those pictures
FabianOefner_2013G-0071054-0071390 thank you very much
FahadAlAttiya_2012S-0008939-0010824 and you can see that life expectancy was also short most people died around the age of fifty so let's move to chapter two the oil era one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine that's when they discovered oil but unfortunately it wasn't really fully exploited commercially until after the second
FahadAlAttiya_2012S-0013513-0014301 and we're all a population of about three hundred thousand people in the same country there are about five or six accents in this country as i speak
FahadAlAttiya_2012S-0026210-0026461 thousand seven hundred and eighty two
FahadAlAttiya_2012S-0037327-0039130 and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land the limited number of farmers that we have have been pushed out of their farming practices as a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions etc etc so we also face risks
FahadAlAttiya_2012S-0050451-0050790 we are only sixty years old but we want to live forever

FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P-0047171-0048072 what you might call a spiritual experience a moment in your lives when for a few seconds a minute perhaps
FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P-0056440-0057472 you are the one whom we should all be towards for whose purpose we live and for whose purpose we shall die and for

FeisalAbdulRauf_2009P-0082874-0083652 but before the human soul why because the soul the human soul embodies

FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S-0004290-0005363 benki comes from a village so remote up in the amazon that to get there either you have to fly and land on water or go by canoe for several days
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S-0015912-0016507 he began to talk to them about the forest that they needed to protect the way of life they needed to nurture
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S-0030592-0031593 for me the world is veering towards a future we don't much want when we really thing about it deep inside it's a future we don't know the details of
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S-0044110-0045159 i started life as a banker now i don't admit to that to anybody but my very close friends but for the past eight years i've done something completely different
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S-0062916-0063833 he's a leaders quest fellow and that helps him with his work they've pioneered a different approach to villages instead of handing out information in pamphlets as is so often the case
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S-0075483-0076261 so that he now has over eight million pieces in his museums documenting contemporary chinese history
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S-0082684-0083633 of documents and artifacts commemorating the u s role in fighting on the chinese side in that long war the flying tigers
FieldsWickerMiurin_2009S-0089367-0090107 they've gone away from what they did before and they've gone to something they didn't know
FioOmenetto_2011-0005316-0006333 it's implantable in the human body without causing any immune response it actually gets reintegrated in the body and it's technological so it can do things like microelectronics
FioOmenetto_2011-0020509-0021650 and we can store information that's film with water and protein so we tried something out and we wrote a message in a piece of silk which is right here and the message is over there and much like in the dvd you can read it out optically
FioOmenetto_2011-0042265-0043073 it's edible so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food it doesn't taste good so
FrancisCollins_2012P-0007298-0008040 it's exciting to see that in terms of what we've learned but how many of those four thousand diseases now have treatments available
FrancisCollins_2012P-0018389-0020011 and when you look at what happens to that pipeline you start out maybe with thousands tens of thousands of compounds you weed down through various steps that cause many of these to fail ultimately maybe you can run a clinical trial with four or five of these and if all goes well fourteen years after you started
FrancisCollins_2012P-0031267-0032881 well that's exciting how does that play out in terms of application to a disease i want to tell you about another disorder this one is a disorder which is quite rare it's called hutchinson gilford progeria and it is the most dramatic form of premature aging
FrancisCollins_2012P-0046353-0046906 so sam why don't you tell these folks what it's like being affected with this condition called progeria
FrancisCollins_2012P-0064314-0065908 and you could expect quite a lot to come from this there are quite a number of success stories one can point to about how this has led to major advances the first drug for hiv aids was not developed for hiv aids it was developed for cancer it was azt it didn't work very well for cancer
FrancisCollins_2012P-0078653-0079077 so let me sum up we are in a remarkable moment here
FrancoSacchi_2007G-0006165-0007031 the value of this industry at two hundred and fifty million dollars it has created thousands if not tens of thousands of jobs
FrancoSacchi_2007G-0017154-0018265 it seemed that for our neighbors and friends africa was either this exotic place this imaginary land that probably exists only in their imagination
FrancoSacchi_2007G-0030258-0031157 following bond in his quest to make an action movie that deals with the issue of corruption called checkpoint police corruption
FrancoSacchi_2007G-0049786-0049947 and intrigue it's the
FrancoSacchi_2007G-0069915-0070415 you know several weeks with all these actors producers and the problems they have to go through
FrancoSacchi_2007G-0085203-0085914 that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers and i think that
FrancoSacchi_2007G-0096002-0097088 censor board has censored one thousand six hundred films alone and we know that there are more so it a s safe to say that there are two thousand films so imagine forty five films per week
FrancoSacchi_2007G-0103529-0104489 and i have to say this really proves that storytelling it's a commodity it's a staple there is no life without stories
FrankGehry_1990-0011517-0012851 then once i deal with the context i then try to make a place that's comfortable and private and fairly serene as i hope you'll find that slide on the right
FrankGehry_1990-0019698-0020668 upstage the neighborhood one made accommodations i tried to be inclusive to include the buildings in the neighborhood whether they were buildings i liked or not
FrankGehry_1990-0031380-0031763 said that fish were five hundred million years earlier than man
FrankGehry_1990-0038427-0038695 i was asked to do some sketches on
FrankGehry_1990-0054686-0054724 want
FrankGehry_1990-0071443-0072118 people hate it and i'm fascinated with that which like the paper furniture it's one of those materials and
FrankGehry_1990-0086944-0087418 was a sculpture and it was all of one material and the metal could go on
FrankGehry_1990-0103515-0104754 building but he put some funny details on it and he moved it closer to my building and so i decided to put him in a
FrankGehry_1990-0118949-0119219 and this is a laser laboratory at the university
FrankGehry_1990-0133185-0133387 i thought it was fitting for me to be doing
FrankGehry_1990-0143176-0143914 and we had the opportunity to build a building on this site there's a railroad track this is the
FrankGehry_1990-0157134-0157382 following that basic idea of the village
FrankGehry_1990-0167176-0167898 anyway you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees that's the living room
FrankGehry_1990-0179226-0179987 and it's a freeway building you go under this bridge at about sixty five miles an hour and there's another bridge here and you're through this room
FrankGehry_1990-0190080-0190318 it's a very dense program bookstores
FrankGehry_1990-0196566-0196882 but out of it came finally this resolution where the
FrankGehry_1990-0201502-0202007 so that coming on the point these housing units made a gesture
FrankGehry_1990-0211371-0211569 and then this is a kind of a shopping mall
FrankGehry_1990-0225730-0226082 see that skylight goes down and becomes that one so
FrankGehry_1990-0236369-0236835 many models this was our original model these were the three
FrankGehry_1990-0248288-0248829 and getting skylights in the four corners and so it will be quite a different shape
FrankGehry_1990-0260877-0261067 to the hotel people the other day
FrankGehry_2002-0007576-0008611 i'd like to start again just start this session again the gentleman to my left is the very famous perhaps overly famous frank gehry
FrankGehry_2002-0018284-0019379 when i started out i thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff and i realized when i'd come in to the meetings with these
FrankGehry_2002-0023965-0024899 building this huge concrete place and it was late in the evening we'd had a lot to drink we were standing out in the desert all alone and he said
FrankGehry_2002-0031555-0032462 do it i discard it so i approach it with the same trepidation obviously over time i have a lot more confidence
FrankGehry_2002-0047280-0048430 luckily today most of the people i'm working with are people i really like richard koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that disney hall came to me he's been a cheerleader
FrankGehry_2002-0061569-0062264 wasn't i just stopped i mean charlie moore did a bunch of it but it didn't feel good to me
FrankGehry_2002-0072729-0073317 near the current campus anyway he's that kind of patron it's not his money of course
FrankGehry_2002-0089853-0090579 they were there three days and it rained every day and they kept walking around i noticed they were looking under things
FrankGehry_2002-0102446-0103150 bilbao i think shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases
FrankGehry_2002-0114895-0115758 one or two meetings in one case i flew all the way to malaga with a team because the thing was signed
FrankGehry_2002-0125454-0126242 they just brought us there to hustle this group you know to create a project and we get a lot of that
FrankWarren_2012-0001967-0003536 it all started with a crazy idea in november of two thousand and four i printed up three thousand self addressed postcards just like this they were blank on one side and on the other side i listed some simple instructions
FrankWarren_2012-0011122-0012309 secrets can take many forms they can be shocking or silly or soulful they can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we'll never meet
FrankWarren_2012-0031770-0033007 he said for three years my girlfriend and i we've made it this sunday morning ritual to visit the postsecret blog together and read the secrets out loud i read some to her she reads some to me
FrankWarren_2012-0042990-0044393 matty invites people to mail him digital cameras that they've found memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos and matty takes the pictures off these cameras and posts them on his website every week
FrankWarren_2012-0054437-0055252 they said that by preserving those voices and sharing them it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive
FransDeWaal_2011X-0016801-0018768 the wolf is after all a very cooperative animal and that's why many of you have a dog at home which has all these characteristics also and it's really unfair to humanity because humanity is actually much more cooperative and empathic than given credit for so i started getting interested in those issues and studying that in other animals
FransDeWaal_2011X-0038176-0038919 and so they come together they arrive together they pick it up together and they pull together so it's actually fairly simple for them
FransDeWaal_2011X-0056204-0057051 an animated head that yawns and there's a chimpanzee watching an actual real chimpanzee watching a computer screen on which we play these animations
FransDeWaal_2011X-0067888-0068449 so if this chimp makes the selfish choice which is the red token in this case
FransDeWaal_2011X-0090957-0091332 let me tell you i still have two minutes left let me tell you a funny story about this
FransLanting_2005-0005585-0006602 before the sky turned blue there's stromatolites down there the first living things to capture photosynthesis
FransLanting_2005-0025304-0025414 living structures
FransLanting_2005-0038264-0038416 fish tried amphibian
FransLanting_2005-0056642-0056803 plants began to diversify
FransLanting_2005-0067319-0067396 world went down
FransLanting_2005-0079529-0079652 primates emerge
FrederickBalagadde_2010U-0004836-0005830 so what the western countries developed countries have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in third world countries who actually can't afford these medications
FrederickBalagadde_2010U-0010865-0011571 i experienced this firsthand as a high school student in uganda this was in the nineties during the peak of the
FrederickBalagadde_2010U-0018576-0019301 this is a microfluidic chip that i developed a close look at how the technology works these are channels that are about the size of a human hair
FreemanDyson_2003-0005898-0006965 but nobody remembers that what they remember is of course the great triumph that the brits were beaten and we won and that the country was
FreemanDyson_2003-0020110-0020887 i won't say anymore you can take it on from there it's going to happen and i think it has to happen
FreemanDyson_2003-0031522-0032592 some interesting places a little further out the moons of jupiter and saturn particularly there's a place called europa which is europa is one of the moons of jupiter
FreemanDyson_2003-0042450-0043397 in the cold of the outer solar system but they are biologically very interesting indeed because they consist primarily of ice
FreemanDyson_2003-0051960-0052832 but it still could have come you can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp through cracks in the ice
FreemanDyson_2003-0065866-0067004 but the sun is the only object in the universe that's close enough and bright enough actually to be detectable you can easily calculate that radio waves from the sun are fairly faint
FreemanDyson_2003-0079241-0079911 the rabbits compete with the sheep in new zealand so the farmers go out at night with heavily armed jeeps
FreemanDyson_2003-0092071-0093226 any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck especially if you breath air it's very hard to get from planet a to planet b because there's no air in between but if you breathe
FreemanDyson_2003-0103859-0104802 and then of course our whole view of life in the universe will change if we don't find them then we can create them ourselves
FreemanHrabowski_2013-0001256-0002667 talking about the success of my campus the university of maryland baltimore county umbc in educating students of all types across the arts and humanities and the science and engineering areas
FreemanHrabowski_2013-0011518-0011725 if we can get the children
FreemanHrabowski_2013-0024638-0024893 to take ownership of their education
FreemanHrabowski_2013-0041658-0042044 succeed and graduate in those areas and only forty two percent of asian americans
FreemanHrabowski_2013-0057005-0058829 secondly it's not about test scores only test scores are important but they're not the most important thing one young woman had great grades but test scores were not as high but she had a factor that was very important she never missed a day of school k twelve there was fire in that belly that young woman went on and she is today with an m d ph d from hopkins
FreemanHrabowski_2013-0075240-0075516 because so many students are bored in class
FreemanHrabowski_2013-0083134-0084296 it is amazing how the dreams and the values can make all the difference in the world when i was a twelve year old child in the jail in birmingham i kept thinking i wonder what my future could be
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012-0004411-0004780 and also laughter the lives of my friends
GabrielBarciaColombo_2012-0022491-0023016 and then if you punch the clock you'll actually transform the baby into a toddler
GarikIsraelian_2009G-0012588-0013829 because they thought that if you are having a telescope you are an astronomer so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescope and you might have seen the planet going into a star and i was saying no excuse me
GarikIsraelian_2009G-0023361-0024478 we can actually study line of sight velocities of cosmic objects and we can also study chemical compostion and physical parameters of stars galaxies
GarikIsraelian_2009G-0039932-0040723 my colleagues comparing composition of chemical elements in different galactic stars actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy
GarikIsraelian_2009G-0053048-0054328 doppler effect is something very important from fundamental physics and this is related to the change of the frequency of a moving source the doppler effect is used to discover extrasolar planets
GarikIsraelian_2009G-0065417-0066235 now we have been measuring abundancy of or thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets it's exactly the same game a very tiny
GarikIsraelian_2009G-0076197-0076907 you can actually go and detect and study a chemical composition of planets far far
GarikIsraelian_2009G-0089840-0091128 showing a presence of nitrogen oxide as a clear signal of life and oxygen and ozone if one day and i think it will be within fifteen years from now or twenty years
GarrettLisi_2008-0006539-0006864 now after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high
GarrettLisi_2008-0025232-0026117 this is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting it's going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what's ever been done before so we're going to get to see some new particles very soon
GarrettLisi_2008-0038913-0039331 but if we plot them out according to their charges some beautiful patterns emerge
GarrettLisi_2008-0053059-0053260 these patterns of charges are not just pretty
GarrettLisi_2008-0068851-0069050 this is the way theories of unification work
GarrettLisi_2008-0081293-0081848 with a particular rotation we can look down through this pattern in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis
GarrettLisi_2008-0090066-0090362 of course when other physicists and i actually work on this stuff
GarrettLisi_2008-0096691-0096962 but predicting how nature works is a very risky game
GarrettLisi_2008-0100399-0100589 is to keep balance and perspective in life
GarrettLisi_2008-0111701-0112669 of everything garrett lisi i'm used to coral ca that's right the reason it's got a few people at least excited is because if you're right it brings gravity and quantum theory together
GarrettLisi_2008-0123299-0124148 in this way the way that e eight comes in is it will be as a shape that's attached at each point in space time
GarthLenz_2011X-0010162-0011074 in manitoba this is an image from the east side of lake winnipeg and this is the home of the newly designated unesco cultural heritage site
GarthLenz_2011X-0024383-0024846 the largest oil reserves on the planet outside of saudi arabia
GarthLenz_2011X-0033483-0034661 that would be a huge vast metropolitan area probably much larger than the city of victoria and this is just one of a number of mines ten mines
GarthLenz_2011X-0045526-0047344 process three to five barrels of water are taken polluted and then returned into tailings ponds the largest toxic impoundments on the planet semcrude just one of the licensees in just one of their tailings ponds dumps two hundred and fifty thousand tons of this toxic gunk every single day
GarthLenz_2011X-0059329-0059864 what that does to your soul and that's what we're doing
GarthLenz_2011X-0065099-0065803 this is one of the reasons why canada originally a climate change hero we were one of the first signatories of the kyoto accord
GarthLenz_2011X-0071342-0072388 and also the last refuge for the largest herd of wild bison and also of course critical habitat for another whole range of other species but it too
GarthLenz_2011X-0084290-0084658 and yet there's a proposal of course to build a pipeline
GarthLenz_2011X-0096948-0097908 is going to change our history it's going to color our possibility to survive and for our children to survive and have a rich future
GaryGreenberg_2012X-0013044-0014493 if you take some heart cells from an animal and put it in a dish they'll just sit there and beat that's their job every cell has a mission in life and these cells the mission is to move blood around our body
GaryGreenberg_2012X-0033810-0034419 a tenth of a millimeter in size each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size but when you look closer at this
GaryGreenberg_2012X-0047158-0048622 so every grain of sand is unique every beach is different every single grain is different there are no two grains of sand alike in the world every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere they're like a snapshot in time
GaryKovacs_2012U-0003152-0004288 and the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of this is also continuing to go grow a recent study showed that the young generation alone is spending over eight hours a day online
GaryKovacs_2012U-0018284-0019225 all of them are connected as you can see to form a picture of me on the web and this is my profile so let me go from an example to something very specific and personal
GaryKovacs_2012U-0024389-0025820 so let me fast forward through the rest of my day i go to work i check email i log onto a few more social sites i blog i check more news reports i share some of those news reports i go look at some videos
GaryKovacs_2012U-0033065-0033765 imagine in the physical world if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook and recorded their every movement
GaryLauder_2010-0014463-0014786 over two million dollars for a stop
GaryWolf_2010S-0004449-0005892 a reassuring zero point three one we know that numbers are useful for us when we advertise manage govern search i'm going to talk about how they're useful when we reflect learn remember
GaryWolf_2010S-0023046-0024034 but we think of these tools as pointing outward as windows and i'd just like to invite you to think of them as also turning inward
GavinPretorPinney_2013G-0021600-0021752 what would that mean
GavinPretorPinney_2013G-0037938-0038816 undulating of the air and if the difference in those speeds is just right the tops of the undulations curl over in these beautiful breaking wave like vortices
GavinPretorPinney_2013G-0060734-0062273 being in the present not thinking about what you've got to do and what you should have done but just being here letting your imagination lift from the everyday concerns down here and just being in the present it's good for you and it's good for the way you feel
GayleLemmon_2011X-0010914-0012292 i went to afghanistan in two thousand and five to work on a financial times piece and there i met kamila a young women who told me she had just turned down a job with the international community that would have paid her nearly dollar two thousand a month
GayleLemmon_2011X-0025261-0026747 she had started her business squatting in an abandoned garage sewing sheets and pillow cases she would take to markets all around the city so that she could support the twelve or thirteen family members who were counting on her for survival
GayleLemmon_2011X-0044323-0044684 and capital that would fuel her own country's economic climb
GayleLemmon_2011X-0056451-0056605 and global employment
GayleLemmon_2011X-0076833-0077158 we can make certain that the so called exceptions
GeertChatrou_2010X-0027527-0029293 she thought he will never go there but actually i did so i went to louisburg north carolina southeast united states and i entered the world of whistling and i also entered the world championship and i won there in two thousand and four
GeertChatrou_2010X-0059545-0060366 thank you
GeoffMulgan_2009G-0014807-0016038 and they were people who were not short of wit or grace or energy but they had no hope no jobs no prospects and when people aren't allowed to be useful they soon think that they're useless
GeoffMulgan_2009G-0027833-0028706 and you saw that in the thirties when the great depression paved the way for bretton woods welfare states and so on
GeoffMulgan_2009G-0035348-0036560 again said the two funniest sentences in the english language are i'm from the government and i'm here to help but i think last year when governments did step in people were quite glad that they were there that they did act
GeoffMulgan_2009G-0045985-0046582 the business world some i think some of the bankers who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing
GeoffMulgan_2009G-0058347-0059204 no systematic experiment in the things capitalism isn't very good at like compassion or empathy or relationships or care
GeoffMulgan_2009G-0069255-0069934 and we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement of institutions working on social innovation
GeoffMulgan_2009G-0083267-0084196 within a decade but only with radical and systematic experiment not just with technologies but also with lifestyles and culture and policies
GeoffMulgan_2009G-0094307-0095334 then monarchy had seen off its big challenger mass democracy which was seen as well intentioned but doomed experiment just as capitalism has seen off socialism
GeoffMulgan_2009G-0106394-0106958 to reboot and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway thank you
GeoffMulgan_2011G-0015965-0017457 underlying it was some very simple ideas that large numbers of teenagers learn best by doing things they learn best in teams and they learn best by doing things for real all the opposite of what mainstream schooling actually does
GeoffMulgan_2011G-0029939-0031857 now there's a whole set of new schools opening up this autumn this is one from yorkshire where in fact my nephew i hope will be able to attend it and this one is focused on creative and media industries other ones have a focus on health care tourism engineering and other fields
GeoffreyCanada_2013S-0016210-0016420 what we did last year this year
GeoffreyCanada_2013S-0036636-0037204 so this is not something that is ordained from the education gods
GeoffreyCanada_2013S-0064299-0064697 because in my older years i've become somewhat of a clairvoyant
GeoffreyCanada_2013S-0076443-0076716 that thing lasted all of three weeks
GeoffreyCanada_2013S-0085918-0086429 when the safety of america is threatened we will spend any amount of money
GeoffreyWest_2011G-0006645-0007287 two hundred years ago the united states was less than a few percent urbanized it's now more than eighty two percent
GeoffreyWest_2011G-0025231-0027100 well we understand this very well that is you ask any generic question about this how many trees of a given size how many branches of a given size does a tree have how many leaves what is the energy flowing through each branch what is the size of the canopy what is its growth what is its mortality we have a mathematical framework
GeoffreyWest_2011G-0042133-0043554 it's particularly astonishing because each one of these organisms each subsystem each cell type each gene has evolved in its own unique environmental niche with its own unique history
GeoffreyWest_2011G-0051933-0053730 that's a little thing that lives inside an elephant and here's the summary of what i'm saying if you take those networks this idea of networks and you apply universal principles mathematizable universal principles all of these scalings and all of these constraints
GeoffreyWest_2011G-0062915-0063180 it scales in the same way everywhere
GeoffreyWest_2011G-0075005-0075159 the infrastructure
GeoffreyWest_2011G-0089603-0091017 a major innovation takes place and we start over again and we start over again as we approach the next one and so on so there's this continuous cycle of innovation that is necessary in order to sustain growth and avoid collapse
GeorgeAyittey_2007G-0006026-0006923 james shikwati andrew and the other ted fellows i call them the cheetah generation the
GeorgeAyittey_2007G-0021762-0021786 what are
GeorgeAyittey_2007G-0030367-0030492 now
GeorgeAyittey_2007G-0048624-0050088 a vampire state is the government which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves their cronies and tribesmen and exclude everybody else
GeorgeAyittey_2007G-0060641-0060905 the other sectors the informal
GeorgeAyittey_2007G-0079572-0080326 the american will say i am because i am and i can damn well do anything i want anytime the accent is on the
GeorgeAyittey_2007G-0098451-0098571 what economists
GeorgeDyson_2002-0016796-0017965 some of the sizes of the ships ranging all the way up to ship mass of eight million tons so that was the outer extreme here was the version two two thousand bombs these are
GeorgeDyson_2002-0038277-0039352 it switches so what's upside down is right side up when you go to artificial gravity mode the scientists were still going to go along and they would take seven astronauts and seven scientists this is a twenty man version for going to jupiter
GeorgeDyson_2003-0005878-0006656 doing all these things including changing biology i'm starting the story with the first atomic bomb at trinity
GeorgeDyson_2003-0025760-0026395 a whole new world and these people saw it the guy who was supposed to build this machine was the guy in the middle vladimir zworykin from
GeorgeDyson_2003-0043123-0044395 the input and the output was by teletype tape at first this is a wire drive using bicycle wheels this is the archetype of the hard disk that's in your machine now then they switched to a magnetic drum
GeorgeDyson_2003-0063184-0064286 both results how will i know which is right assuming one result is correct this now is the third different output i know when i'm licked we've duplicated errors
GeorgeDyson_2003-0070124-0070856 began his universe started march three rd fifty three so it's almost exactly it's fifty years ago next tuesday i guess
GeorgeDyson_2003-0080461-0081172 is doing running as a multi cellular organism on many machines he envisioned all that happening and he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process
GeorgeDyson_2003-0096460-0097286 it took really three people barricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing von neumann saw how you could build the machines that now
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G-0008418-0010005 bumping up against to conquer uncertainty to know what comes next that's almost been the dominant aim of industrialized societies and having got there or almost got there
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G-0028147-0028556 and as soon as that happened the birds started moving
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G-0045800-0047564 up in the photic zone where there's enough light to allow photosynthesis to take place and those great plumes of fertilizer stimulate the growth of phytoplankton the plant plankton at the bottom of the food chain which stimulate the growth of zooplankton which feed the fish and the krill and all the rest of it
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G-0062716-0064700 at the same time if we choose have access to a richer and wilder life of adventure when we want to because there would be wonderful rewilded habitats and the opportunities for this are developing more rapidly than you might think possible
GeorgeMonbiot_2013G-0084693-0085256 why not reintroduce some of our lost megafauna or at least species closely related to those which have become
GeorgePapandreou_2013G-0009745-0010729 to be masters of our own fate to be able to examine to learn to imagine and then to design a better life
GeorgePapandreou_2013G-0017936-0018854 you can see me here next to him i'm the younger one there to the side you may not recognize me because i used to part my hair differently there
GeorgePapandreou_2013G-0030001-0030658 the powerful tax avoidance abetted and aided by a global tax evasion system
GeorgePapandreou_2013G-0041229-0042526 but i think today that most would agree that greece was only a symptom of much deeper structural problems in the eurozone vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system
GeorgePapandreou_2013G-0053617-0054969 and then we were surprised when every ad hoc new measure didn't bring an end to the crisis and of course that made it very easy to look for a whipping boy for our collective european failure and of course
GeorgePapandreou_2013G-0064552-0065513 i said we need to before we restore confidence in the markets we need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people
GeorgePapandreou_2013G-0078672-0079884 you see markets and politics then were one unified accessible transparent because they gave power to the people they serve the demos democracy
GeorgePapandreou_2013G-0092898-0093232 where our common identity is
GeorgePapandreou_2013G-0103829-0104650 it is in their interest that all of us are idiots let's not be thank you
GeorgeSmoot_2008P-0002395-0003349 i have my first slide to talk about the dawning of the universe and what i call the cosmic scene investigation that is looking at the relics of creation
GeorgeSmoot_2008P-0009956-0010238 and when i look out at particularly this galaxy which
GeorgeSmoot_2008P-0017360-0018627 that it's a time machine in a certain sense we draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it put the earth at the center of the nested spheres just because that's where we're making observations and the moon is only two seconds away so if you take a picture of the moon using
GeorgeSmoot_2008P-0036120-0037043 so we have this picture which is quite a spectacular picture and i'll come back to the beginning where we're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning
GeorgeSmoot_2008P-0047552-0048136 sort of in our neighborhood and you sort of see the structure and you see this thing we call the great wall
GeorgeSmoot_2008P-0063323-0064532 on me or on the stage it's transparent to light but in order for you to see it we're going to make it white ok so the stuff that's in this picture that's white that is the dark matter it should be called invisible matter but the dark matter we've made visible
GeorgeSmoot_2008P-0075222-0075865 you know when you first saw this picture it didn't mean quite so much to you here you're looking across
GeorgeSmoot_2008P-0086333-0087143 the idea is you know how would you put together the universe in a very simple way we're going to start and realize
GeorgeSmoot_2008P-0101377-0101978 almost nothing that is something extremely tiny extremely small and
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-0001597-0001610 the
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-0012535-0013397 and then to try to cut cost out of it no matter how you do that you're not going to start with one hundred thousand dollar instrument and bring it down to no cost it isn't going to work
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-0026480-0027552 now you say if paper is a good idea other people have surely though of it and the answer is of course yes those half of you roughly who are women
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-0037445-0038363 and there is an example of the kind of thing that you see that's on a piece of eight by twelve paper that takes about two seconds to make and so i regard that as done
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-0050488-0051280 you can't manipulate it very well although i'll show something about that in a moment so you take the drop of blood no further manipulations you put it on a little device
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-0064264-0065265 is that the compute capability of this thing is not so different from the compute capability of your desktop computer this is a fantastic device which is only beginning to be tapped
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-0076127-0077560 and this will work in due course and here is an example of a slightly more complicated device there is the chip you dip in a corner the fluid goes into the center it distributes itself out into these various wells or holes and turns color
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X-0088503-0089107 another light source that detects that light at one thousand hertz and so you can run this system in broad daylight
GeorgeWhitesides_2010-0009075-0009964 which has a container yes and a handle yes the handle enables you to hold it when the container is filled with hot liquid yeah
GeorgeWhitesides_2010-0017098-0017810 there are two ways of thinking about this word i think and here i've corrupted the potter stewart quotation
GeorgeWhitesides_2010-0022076-0022268 you then ask the question why is the water hot
GeorgeWhitesides_2010-0033222-0033908 one of the things i want to do is to help you with a very important task which you may not know that you have very often
GeorgeWhitesides_2010-0045111-0046075 or to a society and you've got obviously an interesting problem all right so let me give you an example of simplicity of a particular kind
GeorgeWhitesides_2010-0058866-0059742 so since the transistor is so simple you can put lots of them together and you put lots of them together and you come with something called integrated circuits
GeorgeWhitesides_2010-0070099-0071104 and two aphorisms the characteristics which i think are useful to think about for simple things first they are predictable
GeorgeWhitesides_2010-0081172-0082377 we are very interested in delivering health care in the developing world and one of the things we wish to do in this particular business is to find a way of doing medical diagnosis
GeorgeWhitesides_2010-0095672-0096726 and the second is a design issue and it's not directly relevant but it's a nice statement this is by de saint exupery and he says you know you've achieved perfection in design
GeorgeWhitesides_2010-0107175-0107784 started to do that i mean with the health system you got a sort of radical solution on the cost side but in terms of the system itself
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S-0011831-0012513 it is the model for all future relationships with friends with partners and with their own children
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S-0028347-0029208 since my first visit to ceausescu's institution i've seen hundreds of such places across eighteen countries from the czech republic to sudan
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S-0039535-0040895 and societies tend to blame these parents for abandoning these children but research shows that most parents want their children and that the primary drivers behind institutionalization are poverty disability and ethnicity
GeorgetteMulheir_2012S-0053825-0054741 across europe a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G-0006110-0007134 now wait a minute you may say how can you go straight to controlling the brain without understanding it first isn't that putting the cart before the horse
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G-0016437-0017498 will so in this situation too to decode the information contained in patterns like this watching alone won't do we need to rearrange the
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G-0029567-0030682 such an approach would literally in a flash of light overcome many of the obstacles to discovery first it's clearly a non invasive wireless form of communication
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G-0041490-0042778 the approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain in this example each electrical impulse each deflection on the trace is caused by a brief pulse of light
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G-0047872-0049056 now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly to a flash it could see susana did a simple but brutally effective experiment she cut the heads off of her flies
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G-0055707-0056501 life is a string of choices creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next we cope with this pressure
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G-0068114-0068167 now obviously
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G-0080798-0081999 and then it turns around this means that the policy that the actor implements now includes an instruction to avoid the odor that's in the right half of the chamber this means that the critic must have spoken in
GeroMiesenboeck_2010G-0095291-0096539 we have created such a situation artificially by turning on the critic with a flash of light that caused a strengthening of the connections between the currently active odor detector and the
GeverTulley_2007U-0006010-0006975 you know we live in a world that's subjected to ever more stringent child safety regulations there doesn't seem to be any limit on
GeverTulley_2007U-0017945-0018827 one of the most elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment in any child's personal history whether we remember it or not
GeverTulley_2007U-0030958-0031258 but you know they're young they heal fast
GeverTulley_2007U-0047374-0048108 get broken by accident and that laws have to be interpreted and it's something we often talk about with the kids when
GeverTulley_2009-0005546-0005820 and lots of tools real tools
GeverTulley_2009-0015886-0016784 when faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities a really interesting behavior emerges decoration
GolanLevin_2004-0006281-0007472 in a way the computer makes possible much more than what most people think and my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer and so i end up writing software to do that
GolanLevin_2009-0013203-0014040 i write software and that's how i do it and a lot of my experiences resemble mirrors in some way because this is in some sense the first way that people discover
GolanLevin_2009-0029861-0030660 and as you do you see the shadows of your own speech and they sort of fly away out of your head if a computer speech recognition system is
GolanLevin_2009-0058547-0059589 was aware that we were looking at it how could it respond in a way to acknowledge or subvert the fact that we're looking at it and what could it do if it could look back at us
GolanLevin_2009-0077151-0077305 snout with a googly eye

HallaTomasdottir_2010W-0031537-0032909 the whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men it is actually about women being different from men bringing different values and different ways to the table so what do you get you get better decision making
HallaTomasdottir_2010W-0048428-0049499 and at one of the campaign sessions she had one of her male contenders allude to the fact that she couldn't become president she was a woman and even half a woman

Halla_Tomasdottir_2010W-0030123-0031952 but it wasn't just about the values although we are convinced that they matter it was also about a business opportunity it's the female trend and it's the sustainability trend that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come the whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men

HannaRosin_2010W-0001545-0002292 we are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very rapidly
HannaRosin_2010W-0015707-0016470 this time it's not about passion and it's not about any kind of movement this is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in
HannaRosin_2010W-0030541-0031623 women young women were making more money than young men so here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around
HannaRosin_2010W-0039627-0040455 have a manufacturing economy which was about building goods and products and now we have a service economy and an information and creative economy

HansRosling_2006-0011347-0011503 because the chimpanzee would score
HansRosling_2006-0023604-0024586 or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here or have they got longer lives and live up there let's see we stopped the world then this is all u n statistics that have been
HansRosling_2006-0032131-0032350 during the war indicate
HansRosling_2006-0038690-0038948 gap between rich and poor any longer this is a myth
HansRosling_2006-0048279-0049023 let the world move forward you will see that while population increase there are hundreds of millions in asia getting out of poverty
HansRosling_2006-0058452-0059302 into its countries and when it burst the size of his country bubble is the size of the population sierra leone down there mauritius is up there
HansRosling_2006-0071320-0071685 so it's sort of difficult to get
HansRosling_2006-0082665-0083473 they are like this now that's dangerous to use average data because there is such a lot of difference within countries
HansRosling_2006-0095802-0095895 which we called
HansRosling_2006-0111444-0112434 time to change for this but on the axises you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have and the thing would be
HansRosling_2007-0006895-0007381 the number of children per woman and there you have the length of life in years
HansRosling_2007-0012607-0013435 i cover my lifetime here you know i expect to live one hundred years and this is where we are today now could we
HansRosling_2007-0016576-0017431 here we go here we go not so much statistics one hundred years ago some countries still had statistics we are looking down in the archive
HansRosling_2007-0034117-0034621 and how long do we have to bring united states to get the same health as chile has
HansRosling_2007-0048502-0048801 i think it's the best way of
HansRosling_2007-0060771-0061573 and everyone is responsible for the per capita emission this really shows you we have not seen good economic and health progress anywhere in the world
HansRosling_2007-0071454-0072459 we can get out of poverty my own research has not been in it or anything like this i spent twenty years in interviews with african farmers who were on the verge of
HansRosling_2007-0080812-0081421 good with credit micro credits gave her the bicycle you know and information will tell her when to go to market with which
HansRosling_2007-0094580-0095696 education human resources are important health is also important but not that much as a mean environment is important human rights is also important but it just gets one cross now what about goals
HansRosling_2007-0107753-0107819 you can hear
HansRosling_2009-0011945-0012022 first we have the
HansRosling_2009-0022668-0023543 the rates fall faster of the percentage infected because people still die in spite of pepfar the generous pepfar
HansRosling_2009-0033111-0034119 and so it is in africa it's a lot of difference so why is it so high is it war no it's not look here war torn congo is down there two three four percent
HansRosling_2009-0048035-0048802 ideas of why it is like this on one hand on the other hand because there is a scientific consensus
HansRosling_2009I-0005517-0006139 quarter of all courses i attended but in st john's i was in the lower quarter and the

HansRosling_2009I-0043408-0044800 we saw the emergence of the modern china in a way which surprised the world and what happened what happens in the after independence you can see that the health started to improve children started to go to school health services were
HansRosling_2009I-0057529-0058461 and here maharashtra with mumbai is forging forward now in india the big inequities are within the state rather than between the states
HansRosling_2009I-0065742-0066927 you can see that in health and education a large part of the world population is putting forward but in africa and other parts as in rural guizhou in china there is still people with low health and very low economy
HansRosling_2009I-0074439-0074815 so they doesn't seem to go this way these countries they seem to go in
HansRosling_2009I-0086836-0087628 and will asia be able to handle that new position of being in charge of being the most mighty and the governors of the world so
HansRosling_2009S-0006905-0007861 so you can see that what we have on this axis here is size of family one two three four five children per woman on this axis and here length of life life expectancy
HansRosling_2009S-0017817-0018697 the wrong concept even active people in the united states had that they didn't realize the improvement of mexico there

HansRosling_2009S-0061753-0062767 that africa south of sahara is at the bottom but when i split it when i split it into country bubbles the size of the bubbles here is the population then you see
HansRosling_2009S-0074116-0075076 people doing that at the world bank are among the best in the world and they are highly skilled professionals it's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies
HansRosling_2009S-0093659-0094720 these green countries are achieving millennium development goals these yellow are just about to doing this these red countries that doesn't do it and the policy has to be improved not simplistic extrapolation
HansRosling_2009S-0105942-0106666 at each place in the way it can be done there so to just end up there are things
HansRosling_2009S-0117704-0118534 so you have a very bad name state department this is not the state department it's the world department and we have a high hope in you thank you very much

HansRosling_2010S-0035545-0035795 of a kind we've never seen that can stop this from
HansRosling_2010S-0048792-0049550 they are still up here and they still have a child survival of only seventy to eighty percent meaning that if you have six children
HansRosling_2010S-0056509-0056782 and look at the position of the old west
HansRosling_2010W-0001619-0002280 four years old when i saw my mother load a washing machine for the very first time in her life
HansRosling_2010W-0016369-0017755 i've done the scrutiny of market data and i've found that indeed the washing machine has penetrated below the air line and today there's an additional one billion people out there who live above the wash line
HansRosling_2010W-0039987-0040270 still the richest people use most of it
HansRosling_2010X-0003221-0004061 and by specifying eight different goals the united nations has said that there are so many things needed to change in
HansRosling_2010X-0014968-0016162 what is the origin of the data is it so that in kenya there are doctors and other specialists who write the death certificate at the death of the child and it's sent to the statistical office no low income
HansRosling_2010X-0027177-0028110 in june i got a mail in my inbox from demographic health surveys and it showed good news from kenya i was so happy this was
HansRosling_2010X-0039977-0040673 to reduce child mortality four percent if it's used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they
HansRosling_2010X-0049131-0049422 and this very fast improvement
HansRosling_2010X-0063479-0064360 education and they got primary health care and down they went you know and they got safer water they eradicated malaria and isn't it a success story
HansRosling_2010X-0077939-0078736 a categorization of countries it labels developing countries i can read from the list here developing countries republic of korea south korea
HansRosling_2012S-0001909-0002350 but it's a broad and very delicate
HansRosling_2012S-0014440-0016147 so we went on and we looked in wikipedia we found this map but that subdivides christianity islam and buddhism into many subgroups which was too detailed therefore at gapminder we made our own map and it looks like this
HansRosling_2012S-0035224-0036918 i can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman is surprisingly good in all countries we get that from the census data it's not one of these statistics which is very doubtful so what we can conclude is you don't have to get rich to have few children it has happened across the world
HansRosling_2012S-0054360-0056204 free of charge i found qatar's social trends very interesting lots to read i found fertility at birth and i looked at total fertility rate per woman these are the scholars and experts in the government agency in qatar and they say the most important factors are increased age at first marriage

HaraldHaas_2011G-0031414-0032737 furthermore replace the remote control of our light bulb we transmit with our technology not only a single data stream we transmit thousands of data streams in parallel at even higher speeds
HaraldHaas_2011G-0037743-0038485 the receiver will convert these little subtle changes in the amplitude that we create there into an electrical signal
HaraldHaas_2011G-0049614-0050660 to have this working and the answer is yes but you can dim down the light to a level that it appears to be off and you are still able to transmit data
HaraldHaas_2011G-0060840-0061311 for me the applications of it to me are beyond
HarshaBhogle_2009I-0003703-0004838 lots of deceit intrigue and like all good soaps it jumps twenty years when the audience interest changes and that's exactly what cricket has done it's jumped twenty years into twenty over game
HarshaBhogle_2009I-0024701-0026074 all over the world and pepsi was this big revolution because they started taking cricket all over and so cricket started becoming big cricket started bringing riches in television started covering cricket for a long time television said we won't cover cricket unless you pay us to
HarshaBhogle_2009I-0045468-0046915 so it was a different india but it was also a slightly more orthodox india that was very happy to be modern but didn't want to say that to people and so they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived everyone secretly watched them but everyone claimed not
HarshaBhogle_2009I-0067283-0068655 to play a game and i just thought to myself wow we've arrived somewhere in the world you know we have arrived somewhere we are thinking big but what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in indian cricket which is cricket and the movies in indian entertainment

HarveyFineberg_2011-0016146-0017792 i've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions because if you look at the edges of the tree of life every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms it has survived it has demonstrated
HarveyFineberg_2011-0032497-0034217 the earth the solar system about four and a half billion years the first signs of proto life maybe three to four billion years ago on earth the first multi celled organisms perhaps as much as eight hundred or a billion years ago
HarveyFineberg_2011-0043185-0044230 now i have to confess when i was a college undergraduate i thought okay sex death sex death death for sex it seemed pretty reasonable at the time
HarveyFineberg_2011-0060487-0062461 have through medicine managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population and secondly we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it and by the way
HarveyFineberg_2011-0076375-0077171 the year after it was finished in two thousand and four you could do the same job for twenty million dollars in three to four months
HarveyFineberg_2011-0089653-0090313 eliminate the diabetes eliminate the hemophilia reduce the risk of cancer who doesn't want healthier children
HarveyFineberg_2011-0102157-0102405 to us thank you
HasanElahi_2011G-0026441-0027324 and there was a sincere concern there and he was like you know if you get into trouble give us a call we'll take care of it so ever since then before i would go anywhere i would call the fbi i
HasanElahi_2011G-0033217-0033754 well they probably have all my flight records so i decided to put all my flight records from birth
HasanElahi_2011G-0043395-0045270 and laundry too laundry detergent at west oakland east oakland sorry and then my pickled jellyfish at the hong kong supermarket on route eighteen in east brunswick now if you go to my bank records it'll actually show something from there so you know that on may ninth that i bought dollar fourteen point seven nine in fuel from safeway vallejo
HasanElahi_2011G-0066900-0068244 they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information or restricted access to information and the reason their information has any value is well because no one else has access to it and by me
HeatherBrooke_2012G-0001672-0003529 upon a time the world was a big dysfunctional family it was run by the great and powerful parents and the people were helpless and hopeless naughty children if any of the more rowdier children questioned the authority of the parents they were scolded
HeatherBrooke_2012G-0023819-0025235 a new government was elected on a mandate of transparency one hundred and twenty mps stepped down at that election and so far four mps and two lords have done jail time for fraud
HeatherBrooke_2012G-0044200-0045302 a very strong right to know so if your water company is dumping water into your river sewage water into your river you have a right to know about it in the finance industry
HeatherBrooke_2012G-0057089-0058552 so that's open source and it can be used in any country where there is some kind of freedom of information law so there's a list there of the different countries that have it and then there's a few more coming on board so if any of you out there like the sound of that
HeatherBrooke_2012G-0071970-0073173 so this came from leaks of tens of thousands of dispatches that were written by american soldiers about the afghan war and leaked and then they're able to do this investigation
HeatherBrooke_2012G-0088721-0090434 because of its seductive capacity you've got to have skepticism and humility skepticism because you must always be challenging i want to see why do you you just say so that's not good enough i want to see the evidence behind why that's so and humility because we are all human we all make mistakes
HeatherBrooke_2012G-0103866-0105670 sharing and protection act you've got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance you have the national security agency building the world's giantest spy center it's just this colossal it's five times bigger than the u s capitol in which they're going to intercept and analyze communications traffic and personal data
HeatherKnight_2010W-0011051-0012407 so it can also learn from you about the quality of its jokes and cater things sort of like netflix style over longer term to different communities or audiences children versus adults different cultures you can learn something
HeatherKnight_2010W-0024932-0025084 me the guy behind me has
HectorRuiz_2007G-0003210-0004067 but what i'd like to talk to you about today is perhaps a way in which we could use technology to make those accidents happen often
HectorRuiz_2007G-0018920-0019538 and how claire de lune which was one of his favorites was a real exposure to me to classical music
HectorRuiz_2007G-0032711-0033589 and in today's world being useful affordable and accessible is not necessarily what happens in a lot of the technology that is done today
HectorRuiz_2007G-0045633-0046571 a myriad of other companies and frankly even competitors so it is really a rather lofty initiative if you want to think that way
HectorRuiz_2007G-0060365-0061514 phenomenal driver of things to force us to do things differently and we look forward to being able to actually working with so many partners around the world to be able to reach that goal
HectorRuiz_2007G-0066553-0067506 is that this segment of the market whether it's education or under developed nations either way it's a segment that demands incredibly high quality incredibly
HectorRuiz_2007G-0075597-0076756 an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place in other parts it doesn't and then we have to be sensitive about how this technology can be developed and put into action in those regions
HectorRuiz_2007G-0087601-0088484 and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids in a computer and i have to tell you that
HectorRuiz_2007G-0103598-0104279 that we have issued to the architectural community to come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region
HectorRuiz_2007G-0114749-0116033 and we're looking at the glass and see all the children on the other side and he said i've got to remind you again that for each generation to do better you're going to have to be a better father than i was that's when it dawned on me
HelenFisher_2006-0014538-0015430 their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party and in this case a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat
HelenFisher_2006-0026552-0027491 my most important question was always the same it was what percentage of the day and night do you think about this person and indeed they would say
HelenFisher_2006-0040312-0041353 i've also come to think that it's one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction one is the sex drive the craving for sexual gratification
HelenFisher_2006-0052137-0053012 very slow for every trend in on this planet there's a counter trend we all know of them but nevertheless the old arab saying the arabs say
HelenFisher_2006-0065861-0066796 women can talk they've been doing it for a million years words were women's tools they held that baby in front of their face cajoling it reprimanding it educating it
HelenFisher_2006-0080086-0081021 why is it that men are so adulterous and i say why do you think more men are adulterous than women oh well men are more adulterous and i say who do you think these men are sleeping with
HelenFisher_2006-0093503-0094284 as much as forty percent of people have nothing really wrong with them so we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age and i looked
HelenFisher_2006-0105004-0106268 at a time in fact you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else it's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head
HelenFisher_2006-0118545-0118634 thank you
HelenFisher_2006-0130058-0130785 and this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student and she was not in love with him
HelenFisher_2008-0004749-0005583 it was built by the grandest sun king of the grandest city state of the grandest civilization of the americas the
HelenFisher_2008-0018216-0018574 here it is i've never had the opportunity to say it before
HelenFisher_2008-0025981-0027392 we found activity in a tiny little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area we found activity in some cells called the a ten cells cells that actually make dopamine a natural stimulant and spray it to many brain regions
HelenFisher_2008-0033138-0034129 are looking at the data of the people who were put into the machine after they had just been dumped it was very difficult actually putting these people in the machine because they were in such bad shape
HelenFisher_2008-0046827-0047798 and you're feeling intense energy intense focus intense motivation and the willingness to risk it all to win life's greatest prize
HelenFisher_2008-0060509-0061398 you know if you spend your entire life in a little box you're not going to be as picky about who you have sex with but i've looked in a hundred species
HelenFisher_2008-0072841-0073601 still become active twenty five years later there are still many questions to be answered and
HelenFisher_2008-0084780-0085448 is from your background your same general level of intelligence your same general level of good looks and you don't feel pulled towards all of them
HendrikPoinar_2013X-0002527-0003375 and we used to imagine that someday they would actually come to life and they would crawl out of the resin and if they could they would fly away
HendrikPoinar_2013X-0019975-0021059 and then they disappear like ninety nine percent of all the animals that have once lived they go extinct likely due to a warming climate and fast encroaching dense forests that are migrating north
HendrikPoinar_2013X-0033567-0034689 but i'll also get all the bacteria that once lived with the mammoth and more complicated i'll get all the dna that survived in that environment with it so the bacteria the fungi and so on and so forth
HendrikPoinar_2013X-0045841-0046494 and there they shared refugia and a little bit more than the refugia it turns out it looks like they were interbreeding
HenryMarkram_2009G-0006843-0008600 and the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet that are affected by mental disorder and the drugs that are used today are largely empirical i think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on how to treat disorders
HenryMarkram_2009G-0021913-0023168 thousands of decisions about the size of the room the walls the height the objects in this room ninety nine percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes
HenryMarkram_2009G-0033665-0034692 if you zoom into the surface of the neocortex you discover that it's made up of little modules g five processors like in a computer but there are about a million of them
HenryMarkram_2009G-0048532-0050296 describe and discover all the rules of communication the rules of connectivity because the neurons don't just like to connect with any neuron they choose very carefully who they connect with it's also more than cataloging because you actually have to build three dimensional digital models of them
HenryMarkram_2009G-0063948-0065001 of the brain even though your brain may be smaller bigger it may have different types of neurons different morphologies of neurons we actually do share
HenryMarkram_2009G-0082374-0084166 so the next step is just to take these brain coordinates and to project them into perceptual space and if you do that you will be able to step inside the reality that is created by this
HeribertWatzke_2010G-0008994-0009527 which is reduced in fibers which is very easily chewable and
HeribertWatzke_2010G-0013721-0014055 so cooking is a very important technology it's technology
HeribertWatzke_2010G-0017596-0018457 our brain is two to three percent of the body mass but actually it uses twenty five percent of the total energy we use it's very expensive where does the energy come from
HeribertWatzke_2010G-0029133-0029714 so because of having cooked food it's easier to digest
HeribertWatzke_2010G-0040658-0041202 and the gut is a silent voice it's going more for feelings i use the
HeribertWatzke_2010G-0052817-0053289 could unroll it get out all the fold and so on it would have four hundred
HeribertWatzke_2010G-0063309-0064613 now both look and this is the blue arrows both look to the same food which is in the lumen and in the area of your intestine the big brain integrates signals which come from the running programs of the lower brain
HeribertWatzke_2010G-0072299-0072596 the signal becomes stronger and stronger if
HeribertWatzke_2010G-0086257-0087321 which taste and reward quite sophisticated to cook to please ourselves to satisfy ourselves if we add the matrix if we add the structure language which we have to
HillelCooperman_2010U-0008282-0009350 torture very funny wow you guys are great and we put down those little floor tiles and then i went onto ebay and bought one hundred and fifty pounds of lego
HillelCooperman_2010U-0015424-0016266 for lego because lego the danish no they're not into guns but the americans oh we'll make some guns for lego no problem and
HillelCooperman_2010U-0022538-0023275 lego cad program that lets you do three d modeling and three d rendering and make in fact movies
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I-0003835-0004345 and it seems that the only thing left for me to say is to thank you all for your kindness
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I-0032480-0033226 duties so it turned out that my fantasy about an entertaining life of being the karmapa wasn't going to come true
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I-0058396-0059427 that's wonderful but we should also remember that we should have a similar process happening on the inside along with outward development and increase of opportunity
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I-0086959-0088372 because of the teachings around the concept of idolatry you don't find as many physical representations of divinity or of spiritual liberation as you do in the buddhist tradition where of course there are many statues of the buddha that are
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I-0110511-0111470 but at the same time i think as some of us have acknowledged we need to be aware that some aspects of this rise are
HisHolinessTheKarmapa_2009I-0132777-0133417 but that if we pay attention we can see that there are little symbols of happiness in every breath that we take
HodLipson_2007-0002754-0003949 illegal immigrants doing all the work but we don't have any robots so what can we do about that what can we say so i want to give a little bit of a different perspective of
HodLipson_2007-0009936-0010686 so if you look you can see a lot of different machines come out of this they all move around they all crawl in different ways and
HodLipson_2007-0016397-0016500 which
HodLipson_2007-0026583-0026998 a couple of that's what happened when you had a couple of
HomaroCantu_2011-0009504-0011036 and then that went into a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create this hollow shell of carrot cake ice cream i guess and it comes off looking like you know jupiter's floating around your plate so yeah we're transforming things into something that you have absolutely no reference for
HomaroCantu_2011-0035285-0036383 certain taste receptors on your tongue so that primarily sour taste receptors so normally things that would taste very sour or tart somehow begin to taste very sweet
HonorHarger_2011S-0004248-0005146 but whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space we have no sense of what space sounds like
HonorHarger_2011S-0032069-0032426 thomas watson spent hours listening
HonorHarger_2011S-0050557-0050934 jansky had made a historic discovery
HowardRheingold_2005-0001594-0002195 to enlist you in helping reshape the story
HowardRheingold_2005-0012994-0014178 humans have lived for much much longer than the approximately ten thousand years of settled agricultural civilization in small
HowardRheingold_2005-0023793-0025130 not too much longer after that the alphabet was invented and this powerful tool was really reserved for thousands of years for the elite administrators
HowardRheingold_2005-0032992-0034357 are based on the internet and in the many to many era every desktop is now a printing press a broadcasting station a community or a marketplace
HowardRheingold_2005-0043980-0044675 or they're going to get the sucker's payoff but both lose of course because they don't get what they want if they could only
HowardRheingold_2005-0058527-0059820 now the interesting part comes in more recently when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures and discovered to their surprise that slash and burn agriculturalists in the amazon
HowardRheingold_2005-0072267-0073079 there were a number of common design principles and those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don't work
HowardRheingold_2005-0086154-0087161 fierce competitors in the it world are open sourcing their software are providing portfolios of patents for the commons
HowardRheingold_2005-0099239-0099985 in developing countries to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world
HowardRheingold_2005-0106242-0107217 that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner's dilemma strategy in the us in the philippines in kenya
HowardRheingold_2005-0111669-0112299 from diseases they thought were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits
HyeonseoLee_2013-0021440-0021980 i could have never imagined that it would take fourteen years to live together
HyeonseoLee_2013-0049312-0050238 he took everyone's i d cards and he started asking them questions since my family couldn't understand chinese
IainHutchison_2010G-0012752-0013737 dysmorphophobia is an extreme version of the fact that we don't see ourselves as others see us it's a shocking truth
IanDunbar_2007P-0001673-0002924 dogs have interests they have interests sniffing each other chasing squirrels and if we don't make that a reward in training that will be a distraction
IanDunbar_2007P-0012734-0013812 this whole dominance issue number one what we get in dog training is this mickey mouse interpretation of a very complicated social system and they take this stuff seriously
IanDunbar_2007P-0031714-0032485 the dog can get you any time the dog can sniff your butt if you like when he wants to at the moment he's in the park and you are competing with
IanDunbar_2007P-0040699-0041910 and now the dog's really happy and this to me is always what training is so we really motivate the dog to want to do it such that the need for punishment seldom comes up
IanDunbar_2007P-0053270-0054109 the dog broke his down stay twenty two times in four and a half hours while she cooked dinner because we had a lot of aggression related towards food
IanDunbar_2007P-0063401-0064248 i was walking onto a plane this for me was a pivotal moment in my career and it really cemented what i wanted to do with this whole puppy training thing
IanDunbar_2007P-0079189-0080109 and i think this whole notion of these skills should be taught you know calculus is wonderful when i was a kid i was a calculus whiz i don't understand a thing about it now but i could do it as a kid
IanGoldin_2009G-0006734-0007578 income has gone up for a majority of the world's population despite the population going up by about two billion people over this period and illiteracy has gone down
IanGoldin_2009G-0024950-0025673 these will be redundant concepts and this isn't only something of the west the most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper type of new
IanGoldin_2009G-0039630-0040409 i left south africa and fifteen years later after thinking i would never go back i had the privilege and the honor to work in the government of nelson mandela this was a miracle
IanRitchie_2011G-0018762-0019631 and this began to get a head of steam apple introduced a thing called hypercard and they made a bit of a fuss about it they had a twelve page supplement in the wall street journal the day it launched
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P-0007292-0007850 god says to his prophet muhammad whom we believe to be the last of a series of
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P-0015076-0016347 but where do we go wrong and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world for the answer to this we turn to our spiritual path
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P-0023725-0024327 the famous sufi master rumi who is very well known to most of you
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P-0033522-0033926 that is dearer to me than what i have asked them to do
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P-0043673-0044692 of god they became part of god's team so that god's will was manifest through them and they were not acting from their own selves and their own
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P-0060077-0060825 to remember to remind each other because the knowledge of truth
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P-0074984-0075589 one absolute being by definition because absolute is by definition single
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P-0085180-0085456 created in the divine image
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P-0091229-0091807 and this is what i understand from my studies of other faith
ImamFeisalAbdulRauf_2009P-0099369-0099782 and let all be for the glorification of the one
IngeMissmahl_2010G-0013435-0014475 this is a picture i took in two thousand and five walking on fridays over the hills in kabul and for me it's a symbolic picture of an open future for a young generation
IngeMissmahl_2010G-0025932-0026685 they try to control the outside very understandably mostly the family and unfortunately this fits very well
IngeMissmahl_2010G-0035067-0036452 to cope with it and to learn from it and i want to engage myself in the bright future for my children and the children of my children and i will not marry off my thirteen year old daughter what happens too often in afghanistan
IngeMissmahl_2010G-0048317-0049363 we wanted to know if what is being done is effective and here you can see the patients all had symptoms of
IqbalQuadir_2005G-0001264-0001484 i'll just take you to bangladesh for
IqbalQuadir_2005G-0017638-0018670 to make economic growth happen so that they could tax people and make more money for to run their business because they were getting it from abroad
IqbalQuadir_2005G-0032583-0033677 tall building in new york i put those two experiences together side by side and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity whether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village
IqbalQuadir_2005G-0044648-0045761 five thousand dollars the question was how much did it cost to install a new telephone in bangladesh it turns out two thousand dollars so if you spend two thousand dollars
IqbalQuadir_2005G-0050474-0051338 and if we are neighbors i could just walk over to his house but then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area
IqbalQuadir_2005G-0057052-0058005 and of course even if that's true then what about initial buying power so then the question is why can't we have some kind of shared
IqbalQuadir_2005G-0070063-0070697 and this is a business for her but it's milk for everybody else and suddenly i realized that
IqbalQuadir_2005G-0082679-0084014 and the result is right now this company is the largest telephone company with three point five million subscribers one hundred and fifteen thousand of these phones i talked about that produces about a third of the traffic in the network
IrwinRedlener_2008-0001326-0002082 so a big question that we're facing now and have been for quite a number of years now are we at risk of a nuclear attack
IrwinRedlener_2008-0023314-0024184 we were totally dependent during those years on this amazing acronym which is mad it stands for mutually assured destruction so it meant if
IrwinRedlener_2008-0038499-0039724 or as many teenagers found out a very very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend and actually so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter and you could simply bury in the ground
IrwinRedlener_2008-0061061-0062109 there are many many sites where warheads are stored and in fact lots of sites where fissionable materials like highly enriched uranium and plutonium are absolutely not safe
IrwinRedlener_2008-0073013-0074421 the point is that we're very very insecure in terms of developing this material the second thing is what about the know how and there's a lot of controversy about whether terror organizations have the know how to actually
IrwinRedlener_2008-0087034-0087822 is a very good indicator of how little prepared the united states is for any kind of major attack seven million
IrwinRedlener_2008-0101823-0102649 in the middle east in north korea other places where the use of nuclear weapons while initially locally could
IrwinRedlener_2008-0116024-0116807 if you look at it you're going to be blind either temporarily or permanently so if there's any way that you can avoid like avert your eyes that would be a good thing
IrwinRedlener_2008-0132647-0134075 and we're trying to tell them it's not futile we can change the survival rates by doing some commonsensical things so the goal here is to minimize fatalities and i just want to leave you with the personal points that i think you might be interested in the key to
IrwinRedlener_2008-0144741-0146080 nuclear war is less likely than before but by no means out of the question and it's not survivable nuclear terrorism is possible it may be probable but is survivable and this is jack geiger who's one of the heroes of the u s public health
IsaacMizrahi_2008-0010202-0011110 and so i'd make the car stop and i'd get out of the car and walk and see that in fact there wasn't a hole but it was trick of my eye it was a shadow you know
IsaacMizrahi_2008-0022821-0023123 i go back to color all the time color is something
IsaacMizrahi_2008-0035646-0036483 it was going on for about a year right and we were getting serious so we decided to invite them all to dinner our parents and we you know sort of introduced them to each other my mother was sort of
IsaacMizrahi_2008-0040758-0041168 it feels i don't know how to put this i feel as

IsaacMizrahi_2008-0081792-0083053 the liquid is actually that clear liquid if you've ever overbeaten your whipped cream it's actually buttermilk and that's what it was in the early days and that's what people used for baking and all sorts of things now the buttermilk that you get is actually low fat or
IsabelAllende_2007-0007061-0008036 a few books but i have lived in anonymity until february of two thousand and six when i carried the olympic flag in the winter olympics in italy
IsabelAllende_2007-0018274-0018401 it is all about passion
IsabelAllende_2007-0028983-0029149 in the green room i received my
IsabelAllende_2007-0038045-0038215 i jogged behind
IsabelAllende_2007-0049091-0049749 tiny little boys she cuts the umbilical cord with a stick and ties it with her own hair
IsabelAllende_2007-0061186-0061922 for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who
IsabelAllende_2007-0073034-0073182 jenny has a brave
IsabelAllende_2007-0080060-0080840 and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence and they are constantly threatened by exploitation violence and abuse
IsabelAllende_2007-0090051-0090224 what kind of world do we want
IsabelAllende_2007-0100303-0101383 but for real change we need feminine energy in the management of the world we need a critical number of women in positions of power and we need to nurture the feminine energy in
IsabelBehnckeIzquierdo_2011U-0007620-0009070 but bonobos show us the other side of the coin while chimpanzees are dominated by big scary guys bonobo society is run by empowered females
ItayTalgam_2009G-0002792-0004226 i go on the podium you know this little office of the conductor or rather a cubicle an open space cubicle with a lot of space and in front of all that noise you do a very small gesture something like this not very pomp not
ItayTalgam_2009G-0019111-0020454 regular just to be part of that to become part of the orchestra and that's great you know audiences like you yeah make the event but what about the conductor what can you say the conductor was doing actually
ItayTalgam_2009G-0031507-0032120 so clear maybe a little bit over clear can we have a little demonstration would you be my orchestra for a second
ItayTalgam_2009G-0039675-0039711 from the
ItayTalgam_2009G-0053866-0054485 so no he doesn't want that that's a different kind of control let's see another super conductor
ItayTalgam_2009G-0066659-0067436 is a wonderful story about karajan conducting in london and he cues in a flute player like this the guy has no idea what to do
ItayTalgam_2009G-0085668-0086184 and look again at this kleiber can we have the next video quickly you'll see what happens when
ItayTalgam_2009G-0110607-0111877 because the meaning of the music is pain and you're playing a painful sound and you look at lenny and he's suffering but not in a way that you want to stop it's suffering like enjoying himself in a jewish way
IvanKrastev_2012G-0013761-0015546 so the government decided to have the elections once again and this time even a greater number eighty three percent of the people voted with blank ballots basically they went to the ballot boxes to tell that they have nobody to vote for
IvanKrastev_2012G-0036797-0037384 but if we're going to see what went wrong we're going to end up with the same five revolutions
IvanKrastev_2012G-0058203-0059754 and when we're now trying to see how we can change the situation when basically we're trying to see what can be done about democracy we should keep this ambiguity in mind because probably some of the things that we love most are going to be also the things that can hurt us most
IvanKrastev_2012G-0080509-0081228 because it's going to be very difficult for them to dissent knowing that twenty four hours after this is going to be on the public space
IvanOransky_2012P-0019670-0021450 and so is it any wonder given all of the costs and the side effects of the drugs that we're using to treat these preconditions that every year we're spending more than two trillion dollars on healthcare and yet one hundred thousand people a year and that's a conservative estimate are dying not because of the conditions they have
IvanOransky_2012P-0050012-0050403 but you can actually perversely
JDSchramm_2011A-0005836-0006942 and he leaped to the treacherous waters below remarkably no miraculously he lived
JDSchramm_2011A-0020675-0021022 need more resources and need our help
JJAbrams_2007-0015347-0016044 you know kind of got me into all sorts of these things he would also supply me with tools he was this amazing encourager this patron sort of
JJAbrams_2007-0033258-0033441 find myself drawn to
JJAbrams_2007-0055913-0056294 the withholding of information you know doing that intentionally
JJAbrams_2007-0064449-0064466 and
JJAbrams_2007-0079580-0080635 signing on online in the morning to watch steve jobs keynote cause i always do and he came on he was presenting the video ipod and what was on the enormous ipod behind him lost
JJAbrams_2007-0103642-0103821 ask for any more money so here
JPRangaswami_2012S-0023360-0025354 and what transpired was that people had put forward a hypothesis that was apparently coming up with some fabulous results by about one thousand nine hundred and ninety five it's a lady named leslie aiello and the paper then suggested that you traded one for the other if you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large
JPRangaswami_2012S-0034821-0035453 the analogies were getting crazy that information had sell by dates that people had
JR_2011-0009027-0009580 i was not thinking about changing the world i was doing graffiti writing my name everywhere
JR_2011-0024517-0025975 so it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television so i went back there with a twenty eight mm lens it was the only one i had at that time but with that lens
JR_2011-0038581-0040007 i decided to paste in eight israeli and palestinian cities and on both sides of the wall we launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever we called the project face two face
JR_2011-0058298-0058554 i called that project women are heroes
JR_2011-0074306-0075030 so that's a really symbolic pasting because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city and that's where the three kids got arrested
JR_2011-0096020-0096795 in india it was just impossible to paste i heard culturally and because of the law they would just arrest us at the first pasting
JR_2011-0120442-0121622 but yesterday the city called them and said look we're going to have to tear it down because this can be taken for advertising and because of the law it has to be taken down but tell me advertising for what
JR_2011-0139797-0140031 and reveal things to the world
JR_2012-0007137-0007326 you're going to send them to me
JR_2012-0014265-0014811 and they pasted over every single portrait of the dictator with their own photos
JR_2012-0026564-0026891 to show his resistance against the government
JR_2012-0034403-0034572 this is the biggest
JacekUtko_2009-0007331-0007436 so what can we do
JacekUtko_2009-0013141-0013810 oh my god maybe i can do the same with these boring newspapers and i did we started to redesign them one by one
JacekUtko_2009-0023954-0024889 really makes it amazing that the circulation of these newspapers were growing too just some examples in russia plus eleven after one year plus twenty nine after three years of the
JacekUtko_2009-0031683-0032508 in your company it can turn your company upside down it can even change you and who's responsible designers give power to designers
JackAndraka_2013-0006163-0006711 the reason today's current modern medicine is a sixty year old technique
JackAndraka_2013-0022433-0022886 i then shifted my focus to actually detecting that protein and thus pancreatic cancer
JackAndraka_2013-0040626-0041125 clearly the professors did not have as high of an opinion of my work as i did
JackAndraka_2013-0060503-0060720 you could be changing the world
JackChoi_2012-0013713-0013952 you can see some internal organs
JackChoi_2012-0024248-0024595 you don't want to hear oops in real surgery
JackChoi_2012-0035962-0036246 and also if you want you can compare
JackHorner_2010X-0014591-0015204 and a better one and that happened for all museums so everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs
JackHorner_2010X-0022075-0022466 and scientists like to name dinosaurs
JackHorner_2010X-0031691-0031882 so this was a problem and
JackHorner_2010X-0042525-0042845 and i can saw mine open so that's what i do
JackHorner_2010X-0055232-0055539 people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are
JackHorner_2010X-0065700-0066829 so it is going to get bigger if you cut open stygimoloch it is doing the same thing the dome that little dome is growing really fast it's inflating very fast
JackHorner_2010X-0079141-0079480 and then as they grow older the horns grow forward
JackHorner_2010X-0088439-0088894 the hole starting to form in triceratops and
JackHorner_2010X-0091857-0092639 triceratops if you've heard the news a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong they thought torosaurus should be kept and triceratops thrown out
JackHorner_2010X-0104633-0104804 real easy to say that
JackHorner_2011-0006701-0007029 i have been fortunate enough to find things like
JackHorner_2011-0014613-0015269 which it is in all social animals in social groups of animals the juveniles always look different than the adults
JackHorner_2011-0026583-0026820 and they conspire
JackHorner_2011-0033468-0033938 and she actually found some very interesting structures in there
JackHorner_2011-0044351-0044600 but this one died at the age of sixteen
JackHorner_2011-0050520-0050785 but she did find evidence of proteins
JackHorner_2011-0058501-0058840 so we don't have to make a dinosaur because we already have
JackHorner_2011-0075531-0075825 and here's an example this is a chicken
JackHorner_2011-0088873-0089068 rudimentary tails
JackieTabick_2009P-0002837-0003585 so when i thought about compassion my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips where he's lying there
JackieTabick_2009P-0015205-0016051 difficulty the challenge that is there for the family for the person and i'm touched so that tears come to my eyes
JackieTabick_2009P-0026410-0027169 of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick
JackieTabick_2009P-0041846-0042796 has to be a willingness to do good deeds but not of course at the expense of our own sanity
JackieTabick_2009P-0049932-0051292 the connectivity of things that something i do here actually does matter in africa that if i use too much of my carbon allowance it seems to be that we are causing
JackieTabick_2009P-0055994-0057051 is what's important in terms of compassion but something else as well actually eighteen minutes is important because at passover when we have to eat
JackieTabick_2009P-0066292-0067442 many people do he was dozing off during the sermon and as he was dozing off they were reading from the book of leviticus in the torah
JackieTabick_2009P-0082756-0083628 of course what you are doing he said to the rich man is answering god's plea that we should be compassionate
JacksonKatz_2012X-0003061-0004184 but i have a problem with that frame and i don't accept it i don't see these as women's issues that some good men help out with in fact i'm going to argue that these are men's issues first and foremost applause now obviously
JacksonKatz_2012X-0017619-0019214 conspires to keep our attention off of men this is about domestic violence in particular but you can plug in other analogues this comes from the work of the feminist linguist julia penelope it starts with a very basic english sentence john beat
JacksonKatz_2012X-0034103-0035487 scandals erupting in major institutions like the catholic church or the penn state football program or the boy scouts of america on and on and on and then local communities all over the country and all over the world right we hear about it all the time the sexual abuse of children
JacksonKatz_2012X-0052859-0053676 is that somehow like i said that they're anti male what about all the boys who are profoundly affected in a negative way by what some adult man is doing against their mother
JacksonKatz_2012X-0067029-0068750 social change it's along a continuum we're trying to get men to interrupt each other so for example if you're a guy and you're in a group of guys playing poker talking hanging out no women present and another guy says something sexist or degrading or harassing about women
JacksonKatz_2012X-0080027-0081561 part of the paradigm shift that has to happen is not just understanding these issues as men's issues but they're also leadership issues for men because ultimately the responsibility for taking a stand on these issues should not fall on the shoulders of little boys or teenage boys in high school or
JacksonKatz_2012X-0096521-0097696 is the mother of all teachable moments for the bystander approach you had so many situations in that realm where men in powerful positions failed to act to protect children in this case boys
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G-0005628-0006779 so humiliated and mortified that i immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater we drove to the goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G-0022188-0023259 ethnic strife and certainly an aid game if you will that was playing into this invisible but certainly palpable
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G-0039835-0040999 where we typically work there's people making between one and three dollars a day who are these people they are farmers and factory workers they're working in government offices they're drivers they
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G-0056841-0057996 transfer technology from japan and build these long lasting five year nets here are just some pictures of the factory today three years later the company has employed another thousand women
JacquelineNovogratz_2005G-0071805-0072779 we have to build business models that matter that are scaleable and that work with africans indians people all over the developing world who fit in this category
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G-0014843-0015638 and of course things are always harder than you think they're going to be first of all i thought well we need a sales team and we clearly aren't the a team here so
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G-0028055-0029004 well it is pretty but you know our color really it is green and and i learned then
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G-0034415-0035220 the second is that traditional charity and aid are never going to solve the problems of poverty i think andrew pretty well covered that so i will move to the third point
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G-0040315-0041161 at prices they can afford i think the market can help us figure that out but there's got to be a charitable component or i don't think we're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G-0058602-0059565 ten days away from proving that the product they produced was at the world quality level needed to make coartem when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G-0076758-0077697 work with malaria and long story short again they've been so successful in our first year the first net went off the line in october of two thousand and three
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G-0094764-0095887 was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines she grew up on a farm in austria very poor didn't have very much education she moved to the united states where she met my grandfather who was a cement hauler and
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S-0006049-0006679 you work on the front lines and you've seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S-0019687-0020538 works between and tries to take the best of both it's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S-0030379-0031157 but to connect those business to other markets to governments to corporations real partnerships if we want to get to scale
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S-0046811-0047757 and when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers that's when patient capital could come in and we helped him build a company
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S-0068353-0069167 we could use this time to invest not directly in government though we would have government's blessing nor in international experts
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S-0081996-0083018 that there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall because one of the poorest farmers on earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him
JacquelineNovogratz_2009S-0097027-0098458 i know it works but i know that many other kinds of innovation also work and so i urge you in whatever sector you work in whatever job you do to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start
JacquelineNovogratz_2009U-0016332-0017065 found herself pregnant with a second child her mom died and her husband left her married another woman so she was again in
JacquelineNovogratz_2009U-0031800-0032805 and in the next couple of weeks she's going to be among the first two hundred families to move into this development when i asked her if she feared anything or whether she would miss anything from
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W-0002262-0002902 and everywhere i'm finding that i hear similar themes on the one hand people say the time for change is now
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W-0016892-0017506 ingrid understood that we are connected to each other not only as human beings but to every living thing on the planet
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W-0030367-0030802 after all this atrocity this is how human beings really pray
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W-0036609-0036827 this idea of empowering women
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W-0040802-0041217 and i would have to admit to myself that monsters exist in all of us
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W-0057882-0058246 and they're doing it and my hat's off to you in kibera
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W-0071112-0071761 but they did more because they created more hatred more rage more fear and certainly despair
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W-0082165-0082615 global warming and this growing sense of fear and otherness
JacquelineNovogratz_2010W-0098789-0099139 we ourselves need to lead from a place
JaeRhimLee_2011G-0008206-0008939 so what happens to all these toxins when we die the short answer is they return to the environment in one way or another
JaeRhimLee_2011G-0022853-0024181 is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food we want to eat not be eaten by our food but as i watch the mushrooms grow and digest my body i imagine the
JaeRhimLee_2011G-0035705-0036337 and believe it or not a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project to be eaten by mushrooms
JaimeLerner_2007-0001788-0002101 my english in the mornings it is terrible
JaimeLerner_2007-0004967-0005347 for the problem of climate change but
JaimeLerner_2007-0010993-0011334 to start i want to introduce some characters
JaimeLerner_2007-0018493-0018619 only one or two people
JaimeLerner_2007-0023152-0023362 it's like two birds kissing themselves
JaimeLerner_2007-0031195-0031473 besides its normal problems they have
JaimeLerner_2007-0037508-0037864 and for handicapped they can use this as a normal
JaimeLerner_2007-0045074-0046109 they called us to develop we're developing this idea and you can understand how different it's going to be the image of rio with the system
JaimeLerner_2007-0051478-0051500 never
JaimeLerner_2007-0054089-0054328 you have to have good relationship with
JaimeLerner_2007-0058939-0059155 and after the children they
JaimeLerner_2007-0065842-0066252 our family portrait even if we don't like the nose of our
JaimeLerner_2007-0070159-0070288 we have people from
JaimeLerner_2007-0075995-0076583 planning takes time and i'm proposing urban acupuncture that means
JaimeLerner_2007-0082813-0082878 all the
JakeBarton_2013S-0001718-0003471 in the one thousand nine hundred and thirty s roosevelt put thousands and thousands of americans back to work by building bridges and infrastructure and tunnels but he also did something interesting which was to hire a few hundred writers to scour america to capture the stories of ordinary americans charley williams a poor sharecropper
JakeBarton_2013S-0025686-0026045 visitors are transient we want people who live here people who have ownership
JakeBarton_2013S-0034478-0035694 objects using those same shapes so more and more we're trying to find ways for people to actually author things inside of the museums themselves to be creative even as they're looking at other people's creativity and understanding them
JakeBarton_2013S-0049934-0050714 and we got this amazing email that said while viewing the thousands of photos on the site i unexpectedly found a photo of my son
JakeBarton_2013S-0071930-0072528 of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices but you really get a sense of the poetry of everyone's reflection on the event
JakeBarton_2013S-0090264-0090815 i'm not going to leave you and wald's widow requested that they be listed next to each other
JakeWood_2011X-0012044-0012440 this was a tragedy but it really forced us
JakeWood_2011X-0023962-0025109 he goes home to kansas city missouri he gets out of the military he takes his uniform off he doesn't have that community anymore but you drop twenty five of those veterans in joplin missouri they get that sense of community back
JamaisCascio_2006-0001497-0001648 can be a future that we'll be proud of
JamaisCascio_2006-0013809-0014836 approaches to design that take advantage of the efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings distributed computing projects that will help us model the future of the climate
JamaisCascio_2006-0028779-0030011 the last few years have all seen the rise of innovations in how we measure and display aspects of the world that can be too big or too intangible or too slippery to grasp easily simple technologies like
JamaisCascio_2006-0037858-0038606 of the parasite responsible for some of the developing world's worst diseases african sleeping sickness leishmaniasis and chagas disease
JamaisCascio_2006-0043169-0044003 for many of us cellphones have really become almost an extension of ourselves and we're really now beginning to see the social changes that mobile phones can bring about
JamaisCascio_2006-0059539-0059735 smart mobs for natural security
JamaisCascio_2006-0070429-0071228 i mean simply this the online part of the earth witness project would be created by the users working together
JamaisCascio_2006-0083135-0084105 and crime statistics to the global progress of avian flu earth witness would take this further linking what you see with what thousands or millions of other people see
JamaisCascio_2006-0094853-0095703 we already have an arsenal of solutions just waiting to be used there's a staggering array of wonders out there across diverse disciplines all telling us the same thing
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X-0008381-0008663 a functioning economy or peace
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X-0020084-0020736 the usual physics approach doesn't really work here so what do we know about complex systems well
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X-0030464-0030973 where are economic networks this is a surprising and prominent gap
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X-0043256-0044126 scientists have sometimes criticized economists who believe ideas and concepts are more important than empirical data
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X-0053267-0054090 are in the core only but they make up ninety five percent of the total operating revenue of all tncs
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X-0061992-0062575 which is the probability of imposing one's own will despite the opposition of others
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X-0071940-0072429 could pose a significant systemic risk to the global economy
JamesBGlattfelder_2012X-0082298-0082517 created by conflicting ideas
JamesBalog_2009G-0008929-0009758 i'm fascinated by the beauty of it the mutability of it the malleability of it and the fabulous shapes in which it can
JamesBalog_2009G-0026720-0027666 time in my career trying to design build and deploy out in the field these twenty five time lapse cameras they are
JamesBalog_2009G-0039934-0041170 and like our relationship with the obama white house with the senate with john kerry's office to influence policy as much as possible with these pictures as well we've done films we've done books we have more coming
JamesBalog_2009G-0045812-0046833 and several things are important number one temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere go up and down basically in sync you can see that from the orange line and the blue line
JamesBalog_2009G-0053753-0054504 dropping off into the sea camera shooting every hour if you look in the middle background you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a
JamesBalog_2009G-0064341-0065673 and so there are features on this landscape there's a ridge right in the middle of the picture up above where that arrow comes in that shows you that a little bit there's a marker line called the trim line above
JamesBalog_2009G-0082039-0082652 and here if you watch you can see the terminus retreating you can see this river being formed you can see it deflating
JamesBalog_2009G-0097928-0098163 four hundred foot tall calving face breaking off
JamesFlynn_2013-0004296-0005887 to people who confront a very complex world and it's a world where we've had to develop new mental habits new habits of mind and these include things like clothing that concrete world with classification
JamesFlynn_2013-0021322-0022239 and in other words it was the equipment that was in the hands of the average soldier that was responsible not greater keenness of eye or steadiness of
JamesFlynn_2013-0037017-0037465 and the response was such a thing is to be settled by testimony
JamesFlynn_2013-0052983-0053721 well in one thousand nine hundred three percent of americans practiced professions that were cognitively demanding
JamesFlynn_2013-0075380-0076994 mores and attitudes they had inherited they would not take the hypothetical seriously and without the hypothetical it's very difficult to get moral argument off the ground you have to say imagine you were
JamesFlynn_2013-0096289-0097622 now i should say one thing that's very disheartening we haven't made progress on all fronts one of the ways in which we would like to deal with the sophistication of the modern world is through politics
JamesForbes_2009P-0007320-0007818 also while we were at the table there was a ritual in our family
JamesForbes_2009P-0016065-0016424 for one another they are our family and
JamesForbes_2009P-0030375-0031272 while we are still in our pjs why would daddy bring elder revels any other time but
JamesForbes_2009P-0040151-0041014 on the edges just in case there's someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture
JamesForbes_2009P-0051573-0052579 almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge but he said what i really want you to know is that i know how you feel
JamesForbes_2009P-0063388-0064172 when a service was held at the riverside church we carried it on our station in this city
JamesForbes_2009P-0069353-0070308 the stuff but i got to do it too or as father divine in harlem used to say to folks some people preach the gospel
JamesForbes_2009P-0075189-0075926 thoroughly you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable the question was
JamesForbes_2009P-0086999-0087953 is necessary that all god's children would have their needs cared for so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks in regards to
JamesForbes_2009P-0098313-0098984 is because this is a very special time in history
JamesForbes_2009P-0107858-0108660 made heaven so happy today a a receiving god's love and giving it away a a when i looked
JamesGeary_2009G-0010199-0010933 this is the mathematics of metaphor and fortunately it's very simple x equals y
JamesGeary_2009G-0022496-0023268 why do we do that because we instinctively find or create a pattern between the round shape
JamesGeary_2009G-0041659-0042539 they were each then given one of three descriptions of this hypothetical crisis each of which was designed to trigger a different historical analogy
JamesHansen_2012-0002768-0003107 and what would you do if you knew what i know
JamesHansen_2012-0005729-0007004 professor van allen told me about observations of venus that there was intense microwave radiation did it mean that venus had an ionosphere or was venus extremely hot
JamesHansen_2012-0010538-0011120 i became involved in calculations of the greenhouse effect here on earth
JamesHansen_2012-0027133-0027888 to the president's climate task force but energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels
JamesHansen_2012-0042513-0043160 these floats reveal that the upper half of the ocean is gaining heat at a substantial rate
JamesHansen_2012-0054537-0055475 as you see there's a high correlation between temperature co two and sea level careful examination shows that the temperature changes
JamesHansen_2012-0067073-0067597 and the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago
JamesHansen_2012-0077620-0078940 more than three standard deviations outside the norm fifty years ago such anomalies covered only two to three tenths of one percent of the land area in recent years
JamesHansen_2012-0094126-0096016 to subsidize fossil fuels by four hundred to five hundred billion dollars per year worldwide thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel mountaintop removal longwall mining fracking tar sands tar shale deep ocean arctic drilling
JamesHansen_2012-0104635-0105440 i need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions
JamesHowardKunstler_2004-0005473-0006184 a lot of ways you can describe this you know i like to call it the national automobile slum you can call it suburban sprawl
JamesHowardKunstler_2004-0009126-0009646 a sense of place your ability to create places that are meaningful
JamesHowardKunstler_2004-0021565-0022325 and if there is one tremendous if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we've built the human environments we've made for ourselves
JamesHowardKunstler_2004-0031660-0032763 it's well defined it is emphatically an outdoor public room it has something that is terribly important it has what's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge that's a fancy way of saying
JamesHowardKunstler_2004-0042995-0043604 this in fact would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits of josef stalin pol pot
JamesHowardKunstler_2004-0057547-0058832 ok the pattern of main street usa in fact this pattern of building downtown blocks all over the world is fairly universal it's not that complicated buildings more than one story high
JamesHowardKunstler_2004-0070338-0071159 and that's it those are the four jobs of the street trees they're not supposed to be a cartoon of the north woods they're not supposed to be a
JamesHowardKunstler_2004-0081993-0082779 on the side because this house wants to state emphatically i'm a little cabin in the woods there's nothing on either side of me i don't have any eyes on the side of my head i can't
JamesHowardKunstler_2004-0089643-0090492 a real school you know but there's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver
JamesHowardKunstler_2004-0105840-0106801 we're going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems and returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development
JamesLyne_2013-0002992-0003659 it's a pretty accurate description this is what someone that specializes in malware and hacking looks like
JamesLyne_2013-0019330-0021206 this is the market leader in malware distribution the black hole exploit pack responsible for nearly one third of malware distribution in the last couple of quarters it comes with technical installation guides video setup routines and get this technical support
JamesLyne_2013-0035164-0036095 so isn't it amazing how much control the attackers can get with such a simple operation let me show you how most malware is now distributed today
JamesLyne_2013-0056016-0056507 lots of you here will use smartphones to take photos and post them from the conference
JamesLyne_2013-0071719-0073396 by the end of the investigation where you can read the full twenty seven page report at that link we had photos of the cybercriminals even the office christmas party when they were out on an outing that's right cybercriminals do have christmas parties as it turns out
JamesLyne_2013-0085978-0087042 your wireless network name is so unique that i was able to pinpoint it using data available openly on the internet with no hacking or clever clever tricks
JamesLyne_2013-0100155-0101829 so my ask is this go online find these simple best practices find out how to update and patch your computer get a secure password make sure you use a different password on each of your sites and services online find these resources
JamesNachtwey_2007-0004459-0006240 i was a student in the sixty s a time of social upheaval and questioning and on a personal level an awakening sense of idealism the war in vietnam was raging the civil rights movement was under way and pictures had a powerful influence on me
JamesNachtwey_2007-0013566-0014484 happens to ordinary citizens one by one and i understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view
JamesNachtwey_2007-0026975-0028682 in guatemala the central government controlled by a oligarchy of european decent was waging a scorched earth campaign against an indigenous rebellion and i saw an image that reflected the history of latin america conquest through a combination of the bible and the sword
JamesNachtwey_2007-0045594-0046486 it was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic of the political struggle that was changing the face of south africa
JamesNachtwey_2007-0060703-0061083 i think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the
JamesNachtwey_2007-0078732-0079554 i spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a railway embankment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident
JamesNachtwey_2007-0096290-0096619 an msf hospital in a camp for displaced people
JamesNachtwey_2007-0111235-0111831 a marketplace was hit by a mortar shell that killed several members of a single family
JamesRandi_2007-0012507-0013394 now i have to do something first of all switch to real glasses so i can actually see you which would probably be a convenience i don't know i haven't had a good look well it's not that great
JamesRandi_2007-0022899-0023627 they claim to be psychics or sensitives whatever they can but the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently
JamesRandi_2007-0033627-0033811 and she didn't answer the damn question
JamesRandi_2007-0042440-0043587 the people he's talking to through his ear you see so what he says is very often is like this he says he tells me he tells me before he passed that he had trouble breathing
JamesRandi_2007-0055520-0056614 to television publicity all the time now what does sylvia browne give you for that seven hundred dollars she gives you the names of your guardian angels that's first now without that how could we possibly function
JamesRandi_2007-0066674-0066798 you may have noticed
JamesRandi_2007-0075699-0076866 may surprise you what is homeopathy it's taking a medicine that really works and diluting it down well beyond avogadro's limit diluting it down to the point where there's none
JamesRandi_2007-0087626-0088795 i think that something needs to be done about this we really would love to have suggestions from you folks on how to contact federal state and local authorities to get them to do something
JamesRandi_2007-0101311-0101615 that i told you about a moment ago she did accept
JamesStavridis_2012G-0004131-0005287 at verdun in one thousand nine hundred and sixteen over a three hundred day period seven hundred thousand people were killed so about two thousand a day
JamesStavridis_2012G-0012499-0013747 open source security is about connecting the international the interagency the private public and lashing it together with strategic communication
JamesStavridis_2012G-0029464-0031351 the bad news is this is a semi submersible run by drug cartels it was built in the jungles of south america we caught it with that low tech raft laughter and it was carrying six
JamesStavridis_2012G-0043102-0044918 eighty five percent cannot read when they enter the security forces of afghanistan why because the taliban withheld education during the period of time in which these men and women would have learned to read so the question is so why are they all standing there holding books
JamesStavridis_2012G-0053430-0054505 it is crewed not strictly by military but by a combination of humanitarian organizations operation hope project smile
JamesStavridis_2012G-0068421-0068704 about three hundred thousand dead
JamesStavridis_2012G-0084131-0085539 i put him here to remind us i would not want anyone to leave the room thinking that we do not need capable competent militaries who can create real military effect
JamesStavridis_2012G-0095516-0096630 us thinking together the vision statement of wikipedia is very simple a world in which every human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge
JamesSurowiecki_2005-0011126-0012009 since this was a high risk location the police had warned the residents and no one was there when the water rose but they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings
JamesSurowiecki_2005-0034413-0035168 what became very clear was that within a few days the outpouring of information was immense and we got a complete
JamesSurowiecki_2005-0047311-0048638 and this is at least to a traditional economist somewhat remarkable because sort of the traditional account of economic man would say that you know basically you do things for a concrete reward primarily financial
JamesSurowiecki_2005-0060829-0061725 and i asked you to guess how many jelly beans were in that jar your average guess would be remarkably good it would be somewhere probably within three and five percent of the number of
JamesSurowiecki_2005-0071442-0072509 and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it each blog post each blog commentary may not in and of itself
JamesSurowiecki_2005-0087000-0087761 is that once a meme once an idea gets going it is very easy for people to just sort of pile on because other people
JamesWatson_2005-0003128-0003300 book so i'll say something
JamesWatson_2005-0013518-0014877 paper there was a review of a book called what is life by the great physicist schrodinger and that of course had been a question i wanted to know you know darwin explained life after it got started but what was the essence of life
JamesWatson_2005-0023340-0024695 it wasn't going anywhere toward you know saying what the gene was it was just nuclear science and oh that's the book little book you can read it in about two hours and but then i went to a meeting in italy and
JamesWatson_2005-0031655-0032317 there i met francis crick i went there without knowing him he was thirty five i was twenty three
JamesWatson_2005-0039422-0040107 was comparable with the helix so we built a three stranded model the people from london came up wilkins and this
JamesWatson_2005-0052848-0053659 tell linus that he was wrong and so bragg said build models and a month after we got the pauling manuscript
JamesWatson_2005-0067829-0068592 that's not the way most scientists think most scientists are really rather dull they said we won't think about it until we know it's right
JamesWatson_2005-0080457-0081005 i didn't really get happy until one thousand nine hundred and sixty because then we found out
JamesWatson_2005-0093952-0094506 way ahead of affymetrix and we use their technique and what you can
JamesWatson_2005-0104828-0105774 thing to a conventional company they didn't do it couldn't do it by conventional genetics but just scanning it we began to find genes for autism and you can see here
JamesWatson_2005-0116749-0118047 and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics which means sixty percent of the people are genetically left handed but only half of it showed i don't have the time to say now some people who think they're right handed are genetically left
JamieDrummond_2012G-0012053-0013763 well i definitely think these goals are worth building on and seeing through and here's just a few reasons why incredible partnerships between the private sector political leaders philanthropists and amazing grassroots activists across the developing world but also
JamieDrummond_2012G-0030339-0031661 there's hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake tens of millions of lives or deaths at stake and i'd argue the security and future of you and your family is also at stake
JamieDrummond_2012G-0044735-0045577 in complex emergencies to help target responses this is some of the most exciting stuff in development and democracy
JamieDrummond_2012G-0063779-0063946 this must drive you crazy
JamieHeywood_2009P-0009050-0009449 it's just a story and i want to go beyond the story and go to something more
JamieHeywood_2009P-0020329-0021381 because we have gone away from the community that we are the fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other we need to give to others to be successful so steven is sharing this story
JamieHeywood_2009P-0037940-0039318 flash and you can see here as this animates over steven's actual data against the background of all other patients against this information the blue band is the fiftieth percentile steven is the seventy fifth percentile that he has non genetic
JamieHeywood_2009P-0049807-0050449 making his constipation worse and if anyone's ever had severe constipation and you don't understand how much of an impact that has on your life yes that was
JamieHeywood_2009P-0069590-0069810 and we bring their histories into it
JamieHeywood_2009P-0078316-0079025 you know a lot of people dropped out the trial there is too much drop out can we do the even harder thing can we go to the patients that actually
JamieHeywood_2009P-0085175-0085337 my brother's stem cell transplant
JamieHeywood_2009P-0095301-0095994 years after my brother had died helped me answer the question about whether an operation i did and spent millions of dollars on years ago worked or not
JamieOliver_2010-0002591-0002650 the food that
JamieOliver_2010-0011524-0011889 this room today in america are statistically overweight or obese
JamieOliver_2010-0021220-0022061 i came here to start a food revolution that i so profoundly believe in we need it the time is now
JamieOliver_2010-0029344-0030399 the family's obese justin here twelve years old he's three hundred and fifty pounds he gets bullied for god's sake the daughter there katie she's four years old she's obese before she even gets to primary school
JamieOliver_2010-0038096-0038148 well
JamieOliver_2010-0046986-0047161 this stuff goes through you
JamieOliver_2010-0057026-0057316 the lunch ladies the lunch cooks of america
JamieOliver_2010-0068673-0068724 good old
JamieOliver_2010-0080364-0080597 you know eight tablespoons of sugar
JamieOliver_2010-0087297-0088613 in my world what do we need to do here is the thing right it can not just come from one source to reboot and make real tangible change real change so that i could look you in the white of the eyes and say in ten years time
JamieOliver_2010-0102373-0103153 young parents and be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of cooking no matter what recession hits them next time if you can cook
JamieOliver_2010-0116058-0116164 farm to school set
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G-0001745-0002209 is about righting writing wrongs no the sound's not faulty righting writing wrongs
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G-0012589-0013577 now i didn't start this fire but i did pour petrol on it i moved to dubai as the head of original content for a western tv network my job was to connect the brand with a middle eastern audience
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G-0016593-0017737 now as with any new idea it wasn't easy i had four phases to this plan first we'd need to buy content from the west and air it then i'd bring my friends and we'd show local amateurs how it's done we would film that and air it
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G-0021806-0021943 and it was getting great hits on
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G-0031875-0032458 we auditioned amateurs we filmed that process and aired a documentary i called it three guys and
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G-0041158-0041948 for example when dean talks the ticker says u s suspect gave actionable intel well if you're used to listening to comedians
JamilAbuWardeh_2010G-0050639-0051398 and let's start righting writing wrongs i'd like to end before going back to the middle east with a quote from one of the greatest sheikhs
JanChipchase_2007-0009093-0009461 when you walk out that door what do you consider to take with you
JanChipchase_2007-0017798-0018269 it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask but really the question is why
JanChipchase_2007-0026302-0026726 is both personal and so it also gives you a degree of privacy and it's convenient
JanChipchase_2007-0037704-0037891 and what you can delegate to other people
JanChipchase_2007-0048473-0049121 and it works like this so let's say june you're in a village rural village i'm in kampala
JanChipchase_2007-0060584-0060766 you go on the streets of india and china
JanChipchase_2007-0070094-0070724 and we look at this and we think well how does that apply for example for the design of the lessons from this apply to the design
JanChipchase_2007-0080156-0080349 of the values of livestrong
JanChipchase_2007-0088177-0089224 and so the speed of the adoption of things is just going to become that much more rapid in a way that we just totally cannot conceive when you get it to six point three billion and the growth in the world's population
JaneChen_2009I-0003142-0004392 what you see here is a premature baby he looks like he's resting peacefully but in fact he's struggling to stay alive because he can't regulate his own body temperature this baby is so tiny he doesn't have enough fat on his body to stay warm
JaneChen_2009I-0019574-0020732 and it creates a warm micro environment for the baby looks simple but we've reiterated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors moms and clinicians
JaneFonda_2011X-0007487-0008036 as different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood
JaneFonda_2011X-0014071-0015694 as i was approaching my late forty s when i would wake up in the morning my first six thoughts would all be negative and i got scared i thought oh my gosh i'm going to become a crotchety old lady but now that i am actually smack dab in the middle of my own third act
JaneFonda_2011X-0023772-0024619 entropy means that everything in the world everything is in a state of decline and decay the arch there's only one exception
JaneFonda_2011X-0038325-0039014 i had to know where i'd been and so i went back and i studied my first two acts
JaneFonda_2011X-0051031-0052265 is how we relate to these realities what kind of meaning we assign them what kind of attitude we cling to about them what state of mind we allow them to trigger
JaneGoodall_2002-0002089-0002946 and secondly i feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of people these amazing talks that we've had
JaneGoodall_2002-0014999-0016254 so there he is with his little laptop computer but fighting against the might of the pressures because of the debt the foreign debt of ecuador fighting the pressure of world bank
JaneGoodall_2002-0031848-0033052 especially when chimpanzees and other animals with large brains are studied in captivity modern technology is helping us to search for the upper levels of cognition
JaneGoodall_2002-0048222-0049460 the reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time it was thought that humans and only humans used and made tools when i was at school we were defined as man the tool maker
JaneGoodall_2002-0058754-0059408 the long term affectionate supportive bonds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother with
JaneGoodall_2002-0072783-0073744 the sad thing is that these chimpanzees who've perhaps taught us more than any other creature a little humility are in the wild disappearing very fast
JaneGoodall_2002-0083722-0084499 culture is being destroyed along with the animals upon whom they depend so when the logging camp moves there's nothing left
JaneGoodall_2002-0094653-0095383 in the developed world in a way it's worse because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what we're doing do
JaneGoodall_2002-0108789-0109589 they were feeling well it doesn't matter what we do eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die everything is hopeless we're always being told so by the media
JaneGoodall_2002-0121731-0123004 one for animals including domestic animals and i have to say i learned everything i know about animal behavior even before i got to gombe and the chimps from my dog rusty who was my childhood companion
JaneGoodall_2002-0135065-0135811 system that will help these young people to communicate their excitement but also and this is so important to
JaneGoodall_2002-0147676-0148755 the human brain i don't need to say anything about that now that we know what the problems are around the world human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems and we've talked a lot about
JaneGoodall_2002-0161035-0161605 it's in our hands it's in your hands and my hands and those of our children
JaneGoodall_2007G-0005635-0006325 he was talking about this amazing three year old australopithecene child selam
JaneGoodall_2007G-0012124-0012891 behavior patterns similar or the same in our closest living relatives the great apes and humans today
JaneGoodall_2007G-0027044-0027854 greeting chimpanzees embracing they also kiss hold hands pat one another on the back and they swagger and they throw rocks
JaneGoodall_2007G-0041558-0042438 way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park it started small with twelve villages it's now in twenty four
JaneGoodall_2007G-0056979-0058197 and as these villages have a better standard of life they are actually agreeing to put between ten percent and twenty percent of their land in the highlands aside so that once again
JaneGoodall_2007G-0071369-0072119 today major decisions and i'm not particularly talking about africa here but the developed world major decisions
JaneGoodall_2007G-0085932-0086733 wasn't surprising to me that as i was traveling around the world i met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope
JaneGoodall_2007G-0096907-0098265 every one of us in this room we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make the very poor have no choice its up to us to change things so that the poor have choice as well
JaneGoodall_2007G-0115953-0116888 deserts where once there was forest do you really have hope well yes you can't come to a conference like ted and not have hope can you
JaneGoodall_2007G-0125870-0126699 and the next reason for hope nature is amazingly resilient you can take an area that's absolutely destroyed with time and perhaps some help
JaneGoodall_2007G-0132338-0133053 really inspiring we could make a very long list but obviously nelson mandela emerging from seventeen years of hard physical
JaneMcGonigal_2012G-0013982-0014763 i hate games waste of life imagine getting to the end of your life and regretting all that time
JaneMcGonigal_2012G-0034414-0035238 changes how we think and act in real life making us more courageous more ambitious more committed to our goals
JaneMcGonigal_2012G-0048348-0049697 so i created a role playing recovery game called jane the concussion slayer now this became my new secret identity and the first thing i did as a slayer was call my twin sister i have an identical twin sister named kelly and tell her
JanePoynter_2009-0004910-0005779 here in biosphere one well it takes me about two minutes because i pick up the phone and i call and say hey can you deliver the pizza so biosphere two
JanePoynter_2009-0020437-0020623 we lived in so on the top
JanePoynter_2009-0037410-0038245 it was time for us to put oxygen in and you might think well boy your life support system was failing you
JanePoynter_2009-0050692-0051164 for hours in the isles of shops reading all the names on all of the things people must have thought i was
JanePoynter_2009-0056922-0057759 and i'm also proud to announce that you're getting a sneak preview on friday we're going to announce that we're actually forming a team to
JanePoynter_2009-0064140-0065047 it was astonishing they were also producing mangroves in a plantation and the mangroves where providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals
JanePoynter_2009-0075248-0076448 in the process of transforming from this to what i would call a biophilic society one where we learn to nurture society now it may not seem like it
JanePoynter_2009-0085985-0087170 it has also given us this the ability to look at the world from the outside now we may not all have another biosphere that we can run to and compare it to this biosphere
JanePoynter_2009X-0001834-0002558 of living inside two biospheres of course we all here in this room live in biosphere one
JanePoynter_2009X-0016890-0017817 and we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else in the universe if we were going to go to mars for instance would we take a biosphere with us to live in it we also wanted to know
JanePoynter_2009X-0045541-0045888 people on the other hand was a different subject we were
JanePoynter_2009X-0064924-0065362 and the mangroves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals
JanePoynter_2009X-0085400-0086154 the industrial revolution and prometheus has given us this the ability to light up the world
JanetEchelman_2011-0003515-0004213 i was an unlikely person to be doing this i never studied sculpture engineering or architecture
JanetEchelman_2011-0016568-0017468 he asked if i could build this as a permanent piece for the city i didn't know if i could do that and preserve my art durable
JanetEchelman_2011-0027220-0027657 it was hard to believe that what i had imagined was now built
JanetEchelman_2011-0035988-0036420 like an x ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding
JanetEchelman_2011-0048692-0048850 fourteen years ago
JanineBenyus_2005-0003303-0005163 critters which is the western grebe you haven't lived until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance i was on bowman lake in glacier national park which is a long skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it and my partner and i have a rowing shell and so we were rowing
JanineBenyus_2005-0021610-0022656 big problems give me a design challenge sustainability speed bump that's keeping you from being sustainable and they said scaling which is the build up of minerals inside of pipes
JanineBenyus_2005-0033883-0034927 first day they would take a hike and it was click click click click five minutes later they were back in the boat we're done you know i've seen that island after this
JanineBenyus_2005-0042978-0044353 and learning something from it now in a group with so many it people i do have to mention that one i'm not going to talk about and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things on the software side
JanineBenyus_2005-0049204-0049758 the plane you came in cars the seats that you're sitting on how do we redesign
JanineBenyus_2005-0059416-0059540 i'm reading more and more now
JanineBenyus_2005-0069945-0070753 precursors to a pv cell to a solar cell onto a roof and having it self assemble into a layered structure that harvests light
JanineBenyus_2005-0081552-0082624 out of co two he's found a way he's found a catalyst and he's found a way to take co two and make it into polycarbonates biodegradable plastics out of co two how plant like
JanineBenyus_2005-0095928-0096877 here are two organisms that pull water the one on the left is the namibian beetle pulling water out of fog the one on the right is a pill bug pulls water out of
JanineBenyus_2005-0104767-0104929 even the toxic ones
JanineBenyus_2005-0110976-0111557 and months and months and is able to regenerate itself and he found a way to dry out vaccines
JanineBenyus_2005-0117176-0117417 when they're involved in foreplay
JanineBenyus_2005-0134010-0134612 those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places
JanineBenyus_2009G-0005600-0006473 that's where i live and it's my university as well i'm surrounded by genius i can not help but
JanineBenyus_2009G-0016437-0017177 and most people knock them down when they're small but it was fascinating to me because i was looking at this sort of fine italian end papers and
JanineBenyus_2009G-0028660-0029457 they have asked themselves what if every time i started to invent something i asked how would nature solve this
JanineBenyus_2009G-0045314-0046195 actually a scientist here at oxford who studied this andrew parker and now kinetic and architectural firms like grimshaw
JanineBenyus_2009G-0061459-0062079 this beetle unlike this chip bag here this beetle uses one material
JanineBenyus_2009G-0074578-0075673 and they're having appliances in your home talk to one another through that algorithm and determine how to minimize peak power use
JanineBenyus_2009G-0089296-0090117 the question is biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate the question i would ask is what's worth solving
JanineBenyus_2009G-0095284-0096631 in order to do this the design challenge of our century i think we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses and to somehow meet them again
JanineBenyus_2009G-0102482-0103706 be able to do as cody does and actually be in touch with these incredible models these elders that have been here far far
JanineShepherd_2012X-0015409-0015933 but this voice kept calling me come on stay with me
JanineShepherd_2012X-0022975-0024593 my back l one they rebuilt it they took out another broken rib they fused t twelve l one and l two together then they stitched me up they took an entire hour to stitch me up i woke up in intensive care and the doctors were really excited that the operation had been a success because at that stage
JanineShepherd_2012X-0036521-0037501 and there were no superficial conversations as we shared our innermost thoughts our fears and our hopes for life after the spinal ward
JanineShepherd_2012X-0045030-0046528 i remember dad pushing me outside in my wheelchair wrapped in a plaster body cast and feeling the sun on my face for the first time i soaked it up and i thought how could i ever have taken this for granted
JanineShepherd_2012X-0051641-0052511 i'd lost so much weight in the hospital i now weighed about eighty pounds and i wanted to give up
JanineShepherd_2012X-0066219-0066453 but now
JanineShepherd_2012X-0081976-0082658 and i said yeah and he said well you take the controls and you fly towards that mountain and as i looked up i realized
JanineShepherd_2012X-0094869-0095289 learned to fly in bad weather as well as fine weather and got my instrument rating
JanineShepherd_2012X-0104654-0105182 and although my physical capabilities have changed dramatically
JaninediGiovanni_2012X-0004229-0005253 i'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine a bosnian friend about what happened to her because i think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like
JaninediGiovanni_2012X-0019875-0021457 i learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors share food raise their children drag someone who's being sniped at from the middle of the road even though you yourself were endangering your life helping people get into taxis who were injured to try to take
JaninediGiovanni_2012X-0033704-0034039 where war comes people don't want to believe it's coming
JaninediGiovanni_2012X-0045867-0047535 there was no kind of compensation for you're a tutsi you're a hutu you might have killed my mother you might have killed my father they were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation and i find this remarkable
JaninediGiovanni_2012X-0063044-0064277 and that's what i try to do i'm not always successful and sometimes it's incredibly frustrating because you feel like you're writing into a void or you feel like no one cares
JannaLevin_2011-0008998-0010608 we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe a sonic composition and while we've never heard the sounds from space we really should in the next few years start to turn up
JannaLevin_2011-0016335-0017419 now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to albert einstein to whom we owe so much einstein realized that if space were empty if the universe were empty
JannaLevin_2011-0024348-0025209 that if light veered too close it would never escape a dark shadow against the universe it wasn't einstein who realized this it was
JannaLevin_2011-0041608-0042102 that black holes devour everything in the universe but you actually have to get very close to fall in
JannaLevin_2011-0056190-0057333 but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space an actual wave on space time space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe
JannaLevin_2011-0082646-0083396 but lisa could see the final stages of two super massive black holes earlier in the universe's history the last fifteen minutes
JannaLevin_2011-0097369-0097735 and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it
JaredDiamond_2003-0007931-0008867 there are also societies today that may be close to collapse such as nepal indonesia and columbia what about ourselves what is
JaredDiamond_2003-0027856-0028972 in the case of the greenland norse cultural factors that made it difficult for them to solve their problems were their commitments to a christian society investing heavily in cathedrals
JaredDiamond_2003-0043699-0044681 and for many present societies are there any general conclusions that arise in a way just like tolstoy's statement about every unhappy marriage being different
JaredDiamond_2003-0051274-0052677 these rapid collapses are especially likely where there's a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential in a petri dish bacteria grow
JaredDiamond_2003-0057553-0058353 often subtle environmental factors that make some societies more fragile than others and many of those factors are not well understood for example
JaredDiamond_2003-0074617-0075453 and that led the chiefs to do what's called flogging the land overstocking the land forcing tenant farmers into dependency
JaredDiamond_2003-0090494-0091729 the time bombs of water of soil of climate change invasive species the photosynthetic ceiling population problems toxics et cetera et cetera list about twelve
JaredDiamond_2003-0104879-0105580 things beyond our control our biggest threat is not an asteroid about to crash into us something we can do nothing about
JaredFicklin_2012-0019734-0020078 if you watch closely
JaredFicklin_2012-0031736-0033551 with something like this this is all forty minutes of the recording and right away the algorithm tells us a lot more tricks are missed than are made and also a trick on the rails is a lot more likely to produce a cheer and if you look really closely we can tease out traffic patterns you see the skaters often trick in this direction
JaredFicklin_2012-0054330-0055029 this is fairly amazing to me even on the first view your eyes will successfully pick out patterns
JarrethMerz_2011G-0006887-0007094 and shortly after
JarrethMerz_2011G-0010186-0010769 i was always playing the exotic african i was playing the violent african
JarrethMerz_2011G-0018409-0019248 even though we had been trying very hard now in one thousand nine hundred and fifty seven ghana was the first sub saharan country to gain its independence
JarrethMerz_2011G-0025444-0025743 and they weren't going to let anyone take it away from them
JarrethMerz_2011G-0033376-0033600 we want peace
JarrethMerz_2011G-0045882-0046386 and in the people runs deep proving that the african is capable of governing himself
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X-0006820-0008257 but i had my grandparents my maternal grandparents joseph and shirley who adopted me just before my third birthday and took me in as their own after they had already raised five children so two people who grew up in the great depression
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X-0017962-0018207 and suddenly the author appeared in our doorway
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X-0031872-0032425 and in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house that was filled with so many dangers like an evil blender
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X-0042698-0042929 so he didn't want me to go there
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X-0052660-0053225 so my parents never found out about it i didn't get in trouble i was introduced to mrs casey
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X-0060410-0061539 i was given this table and we had chinese food and this was my fortune you will be successful in your work i taped it to the top
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X-0069833-0071688 from his face and he looked at me and he said forget everything you learned and i didn't understand he said you have a great style celebrate your own style don't draw the way you're being told to draw draw the way you're drawing and keep at it because you're really
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X-0085077-0085556 who was just this really hyper kid i started calling him monkey boy
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X-0099021-0099394 book called platypus police squad the frog who croaked
JarrettJKrosoczka_2012X-0109843-0110855 two beautiful daughters and my goal is to surround them by inspiration by the books that are in every single room of our house to the murals i painted in their rooms
JasonClay_2010G-0013971-0014107 it was a great success
JasonClay_2010G-0023793-0023961 and that this is a finite planet
JasonClay_2010G-0028754-0029410 lot of people like to point to some place else as the cause of the problem it's always population growth
JasonClay_2010G-0037118-0037912 five times what it is today on global average about so we're going to have eighteen billion units of consumption
JasonClay_2010G-0048216-0048788 in every single case the answer is it depends it depends on who produced it and how
JasonClay_2010G-0057459-0058130 because of deforestation soil loss water use pesticide use over fishing etc
JasonClay_2010G-0068250-0068416 so one hundred companies
JasonClay_2010G-0077604-0078157 in salmon aquaculture we kicked off a roundtable almost six years ago
JasonClay_2010G-0086909-0087842 to help twist the arms of the final twenty to bring them to the table because they don't like ngos they've never worked with ngos they're concerned about this they're concerned about that
JasonClay_2010G-0102664-0103465 the rest of the land can be used for something else it's more with less and less again that's what the future has got to be
JasonFried_2010X-0001666-0002612 talk about work specifically why people can't seem to get work done at work which is a problem we all kind of have but let's sort of start at the beginning so
JasonFried_2010X-0021152-0022421 i mean we've all been through this we probably went through it yesterday or the day before or the day before that you look back on your day and you're like i got nothing done today i was at work i sat at my desk i used my expensive computer
JasonFried_2010X-0037210-0037810 i didn't really sleep very well i did the sleep thing i went to bed i laid down but i didn't really sleep
JasonFried_2010X-0051155-0051803 so why does everyone care about someone going to facebook here and there or twitter here and there or youtube here and there those aren't the real problems in the office
JasonFried_2010X-0067028-0067860 but instead there's a long scheduled meeting because meetings are scheduled the way software works which is in increments of fifteen minutes or thirty minutes or an hour
JasonFried_2010X-0081665-0082629 but they're distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing you can quit the email app you can't quit your boss you can quit i m you can't hide your manager
JasonMcCue_2012G-0009653-0010814 for my part what i wanted us to do was just to look at terrorism as though it was a global brand say coca cola both are fairly bad for your health
JasonMcCue_2012G-0025963-0026519 we've got to educate and we've got to have dialogue now
JasonMcCue_2012G-0046594-0047016 off our government
JasonMcCue_2012G-0051613-0053464 approach today well we all know what they'd have done then is an invasion if the suicide bomber was from wales good luck to wales i'd say knee jerk legislation emergency provision legislation which hits at the very basis of our society as we all know
JasonMcCue_2012G-0062942-0063876 we do have to see this as a deadly battlefield it's not just our flesh and blood they want they actually want our cultural souls
JasonMcCue_2012G-0079248-0079702 actually stopped fact because of this action we became
JasonMcCue_2012G-0097023-0097302 with saying if we follow reason
JasonMcCue_2012G-0111321-0112533 lot of people say that communism was defeated by the rolling stones it's a good theory maybe the rolling stones has a place in this thank you
JasonPontin_2013U-0015993-0016613 they went because it was a big thing to do
JasonPontin_2013U-0030837-0031932 silicon valley says the markets are to blame in particular the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs silicon valley says that venture investing shifted away from
JasonPontin_2013U-0043928-0044953 but there's no hope in the present political climate that we will see u s energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus
JasonPontin_2013U-0056629-0057052 most of all going to the moon turned out to be easy
JayBradner_2011X-0012963-0013409 and the very unsatisfying yet scientific answer is it's too hard
JayBradner_2011X-0024666-0025568 why does it not turn into an eye into a liver as it has all the genes necessary to do this it remembers that it's cancer and the reason is that cancer
JayBradner_2011X-0036397-0037432 and so at the time that we were doing this research i was caring for a twenty nine year old firefighter from connecticut who was very much at the end of life with this incurable cancer
JayBradner_2011X-0042751-0043165 and on the animal on the right you see that the cancer was responding
JayBradner_2011X-0054694-0054892 fail to develop fatty liver
JayBradner_2011X-0067498-0068865 an experiment in what would happen if we were as open and honest at the earliest phase of discovery chemistry research as we could be this string of letters and numbers and symbols and parentheses
JaySilver_2013S-0005769-0006001 and i stayed with these guaymi natives there
JaySilver_2013S-0019898-0021214 especially when it comes to the human made human built world we think we already know how something works so we can't imagine how it could work we know how it's supposed to work so we can't suppose all the things that could be possible
JaySilver_2013S-0029922-0031183 this is a little piano circuit right in here and this is an ordinary paintbrush that i smashed it together with beeping and so with some ketchup
JaySilver_2013S-0042529-0044106 i ran these workshops everywhere in taiwan at an art museum this twelve year old girl made a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from taiwan and some electrical tape and hot glue and professional designers were making artifacts with this thing strapped onto it and big companies like
JaySilver_2013S-0059562-0059989 and we actually sent this guy materials we're like we're sponsoring you man you're like a pro maker
JaySilver_2013S-0068192-0068890 professional musicians started using it like at coachella just this weekend jurassic five was using this onstage
JayWalker_2008-0006711-0007364 so that a s for fun the dawn of books is of course important and it wouldn a t be interesting to talk about the dawn of books
JayWalker_2008-0023578-0024902 you can see here in the lower level of the library the books and the objects in the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination there is a glass bridge that you walk across that a s suspended in space so it a s a leap of imagination so
JayWalker_2008-0037857-0038961 right here one lump of coal and what does a lump of coal have to do with the internet you see it takes the energy in one lump of coal to move one megabyte of information across the net
JayWalker_2009-0013462-0014413 why english in a single word opportunity opportunity for a better life a job to be able to pay for school or put better food on the table
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012-0002347-0002653 but not that much in the humanities and in history
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012-0013693-0014001 so steve and i through mathematical analysis
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012-0020161-0021813 so these types of examples today there are just a few of them but i think in the next decade they will become commonplace the reason for that is that the historical record is becoming digitized at a very fast pace so there's about one hundred and thirty million books that have been written since the dawn of time
JeffBezos_2003-0013921-0014936 on earth by not rushing to california and they start to decide they are these are community affairs by the way local communities on the east coast would get together and whole teams of
JeffBezos_2003-0028385-0029232 the dead horse trail and the canadian minister of the interior wrote this at the time thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way
JeffBezos_2003-0046459-0047099 thin horizontal enabling layers that go across lots of different industries it's not a specific thing
JeffBezos_2003-0066224-0066856 these never really caught on either the electric shoe warmer and drier never a big seller
JeffBezos_2003-0077437-0077915 actually kind of an important point in my presentation because they
JeffBezos_2003-0095038-0095816 you believe that where we are this is what i think i believe that where we are with the incredible kludge and i haven't even talked about user interfaces on the web
JeffHan_2006-0021390-0021519 i can bring up a keyboard
JeffHan_2006-0027293-0027312 in
JeffHan_2006-0036718-0037287 and it just does what you'd expect you know again there's just no interface here the interface just disappears
JeffHan_2006-0047073-0047732 now there's a lot of actual math going on under here for this to control this mesh and do the right thing
JeffHancock_2012X-0011519-0013036 now my first professional encounter with deception is a little bit later than these guys a couple thousand years i was a customs officer for canada back in the mid ninety s yeah i was defending canada's borders you may think that's a weapon right there
JeffHancock_2012X-0031424-0032557 and astroturfing is very common now there's a lot of concerns about it we see this especially with product reviews book reviews everything from hotels to whether that toaster is a good toaster or not
JeffHancock_2012X-0050838-0051162 here's an example of the men and the height
JeffHancock_2012X-0062382-0063912 most of you would say that one of the cues you look at is the eyes the eyes are the window to the soul and you're not alone around the world almost every culture one of the top cues is eyes but the research over the last fifty years says there's actually no reliable cue to deception
JeffHancock_2012X-0077415-0078507 it looks like almost every single person here recorded something in this room right now we've probably recorded more than almost all of human pre ancient history
JeffHancock_2012X-0093142-0094061 they also used the first person singular i way more than the people that actually stayed there they were inserting themselves into the
JeffHancock_2012X-0109145-0109540 because in the digital age we live in now in the networked age
JeffHawkins_2003-0017000-0018123 what is conspicuously lacking is a broad framework of ideas in which to interpret these different approaches i thought the word framework was great he didn't say we didn't even have a theory he says we don't even know how to begin to think about it we don't even have a framework
JeffHawkins_2003-0035010-0036086 which is anatomy physiology and behavior you can't imagine how much detail we know about brains there were twenty eight thousand people who went to the neuroscience conference this year and every one of them is doing research
JeffHawkins_2003-0048298-0049395 tell you there's something else and it's really fundamental and this is what it is there's another reason why we don't have a good brain theory and it's because we have an intuitive strongly held but incorrect assumption
JeffHawkins_2003-0071805-0072624 some very sophisticated senses it's got good eyes and ears and touch senses and so on a mouth and a nose it has very complex behavior
JeffHawkins_2003-0088484-0089054 when she sings them the next note pops into your head already you anticipate it as you're going if it was an album of music the end of one
JeffHawkins_2003-0114011-0114817 really hard the new brain is actually kind of easier than the old brain so the first thing we're going to do are the things that don't require a lot of robotics so you're not going to see c three
JeffSmith_2012S-0012441-0012913 for dollar five point two five not an hour but per month
JeffSmith_2012S-0017080-0018361 you want an old fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head three hundred bucks you want a dirty magazine well it can be as much as one thousand dollars
JeffSmith_2012S-0024553-0025244 so none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex offenders re offend within five years
JeffreySkoll_2007-0007519-0007709 and the valley has its sex symbols
JeffreySkoll_2007-0016684-0017338 and so chapter one really begins today with all of us because within each of us is the power to
JeffreySkoll_2007-0028036-0029370 i needed to learn a little bit more about business so i went to stanford business school and studied there and while i was there i made friends with a fellow named pierre omidyar who is here today and pierre i apologize for this this is a photo from the old days
JeffreySkoll_2007-0039642-0040421 the nobel peace prize but there's also a lot of people that you don't know folks like ann cotton who started a group called camfed in africa
JeffreySkoll_2007-0052390-0052595 and i was met with a lot of encouragement
JeffreySkoll_2007-0065140-0066015 and that to me spoke volumes because it's the the film started about a true life story about a woman who was harassed sued her employer
JeffreySkoll_2007-0078821-0079204 and we're also doing a movie called the kite runner based on the book the kite runner
JeffreySkoll_2007-0090030-0090356 and finally an ebay listing for one
JehaneNoujaim_2006-0010854-0011889 my mom had an exchange student and i'm going to show you slides of the exchange student this is donna this is donna at the statue of liberty
JehaneNoujaim_2006-0020979-0021699 with a persian name the middle east peace crisis so maybe me starting to take pictures was some kind of way
JehaneNoujaim_2006-0033382-0034192 you know very pretty photographs and i was like i failed at this but i was looking at this
JehaneNoujaim_2006-0045567-0046792 how are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding or know how to move together into the future so i knew that i had to go there i just wanted to be in the center i had no plan i had no funding
JehaneNoujaim_2006-0056757-0056821 that
JehaneNoujaim_2006-0067134-0067511 doesn't make me believe that we're in world that can live without war yet
JehaneNoujaim_2006-0088611-0088661 one
JehaneNoujaim_2006-0105241-0105301 the
JehaneNoujaim_2006-0114777-0115721 and what i'm talking about is what i'd like to talk about is how can we use that feeling to actually create a movement through film
JehaneNoujaim_2006-0127201-0127518 i'd like for us to imagine for a second
JehaneNoujaim_2006-0136329-0137049 and i believe that this one day if we can create it this one day can create momentum for all of these independent voices
JehaneNoujaim_2006-0148091-0148775 all of these people in these towns would be watching then i think that we can actually really make a movement
JennaMcCarthy_2011X-0011175-0011750 even though we know statistically half of them will be divorced
JennaMcCarthy_2011X-0022685-0023560 actually beyond they don't have sex with other people for instance in the happiest marriages the wife is thinner and better looking than the husband
JennaMcCarthy_2011X-0034863-0035327 one study found that people who smile in childhood photographs
JennaMcCarthy_2011X-0049150-0050077 is contagious that's right when you have a close couple friend split up it increases your chances of getting a divorce by seventy five
Jennifer8Lee_2008P-0006049-0006570 for example serves thermal stabilized sweet and sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts
Jennifer8Lee_2008P-0020345-0021621 so fortune cookies invented by the japanese popularized by the chinese but ultimately consumed by americans they are more american than anything else another one of my favorite dishes general tso's chicken which by the way in the us naval academy is called admiral tso's chicken
Jennifer8Lee_2008P-0037871-0039026 thirty years before the americans realized that whoa chop suey is actually not known in china and as this article points out the average native of any city in china knows nothing of chop suey
Jennifer8Lee_2008P-0052766-0053691 a group was specifically excluded for its national origin or ethnicity so in a way because the chinese were attacked and chop suey was created as a
Jennifer8Lee_2008P-0078291-0079112 like this can't be true but it was true and basically of those one hundred and ten people and one hundred and four of them or so had gotten their number from the fortune cookie
Jennifer8Lee_2008P-0095740-0096633 coca cola but you know it's very easy to overlook the smaller characters oops for example like lem sen who introduced chop suey chef peng who introduced
JenniferGranholm_2013-0010677-0011516 i'm the new governor we can fix this we're going to go to greenville with my whole cabinet and we will just make electrolux an offer they can't refuse
JenniferGranholm_2013-0024537-0025644 this guy comes up to me and he's got tattoos and his ponytail and his baseball cap on and he had his two daughters with him and he said gov these are my two daughters
JenniferGranholm_2013-0028919-0029199 who is ever going to hire me
JenniferGranholm_2013-0030861-0031433 enigma number one how do you create jobs in america in a global economy
JenniferGranholm_2013-0044334-0045570 and every dollar represents a job and where are those jobs going well they're going to places that have policy like china in fact i was in china to see what they were doing and they were putting on a dog and pony show for the group that i was with and i was standing in the back
JenniferGranholm_2013-0055752-0056457 every region of the country could do this you see you've got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation in fact
JenniferGranholm_2013-0066220-0067455 we created a private sector challenge to the governors what if several of the high net worth companies and individuals who are here at ted
JenniferHealey_2013X-0001446-0001952 driving is dangerous it's one of the things that we don't like to think about
JenniferHealey_2013X-0030768-0031789 if i have a gps and a camera in my car i have a pretty precise idea of where i am and how fast i'm going with computer vision i can estimate where the cars around me are sort of
JenniferLin_2004-0033079-0033995 i have another piece that i'd like to play for you it's called abegg variations by robert schumann a german nineteenth century composer
JenniferLin_2004-0086728-0087428 and then when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form solidified excuse me solidified form you're supposed to
JenniferLin_2004-0099558-0100415 i have here seven note cards one with each note of the musical alphabet and i'd like someone to come up here and choose five
JenniferPahlka_2012-0003359-0004362 the program is called code for america and it's a little bit like a peace corps for geeks we select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments
JenniferPahlka_2012-0016839-0017138 procuring software usually takes a couple of years
JenniferPahlka_2012-0025901-0026488 it's not just code for america fellows there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic
JenniferPahlka_2012-0034617-0035501 if you should ever have the chance to staff your city's call center as our fellow scott silverman did as part of the program in fact they all do that you will find
JenniferPahlka_2012-0050556-0051196 that's because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six inch layer on top
JenniferPahlka_2012-0058942-0059435 we can't do without government but we do need it to be more effective
JenniferPahlka_2012-0069387-0069648 so the question i have for all of you here
Jenny8Lee_2008P-0007872-0008263 and if you think about it
Jenny8Lee_2008P-0036904-0037619 and according to new york times in one thousand nine hundred and four there was an outbreak of chinese restaurants all over town and the city has gone chop suey
Jenny8Lee_2008P-0080119-0080301 you know there are a bunch of them including
JeremyGilley_2011G-0003577-0003963 i was told i was dyslexic in fact i have
JeremyGilley_2011G-0031379-0033333 the oau at the time led by salim ahmed salim said i must get the african countries involved dr oscar arias nobel peace laureate president now of costa rica said i'll do everything that i can so i went and saw amr moussa at the league of arab states i met mandela at the arusha peace talks and so on and so on and so on while i was building the case to prove
JeremyGilley_2011G-0050889-0051635 and we have to make this day work it's been created nobody knows but we have to continue this journey
JeremyGilley_2011G-0068949-0070696 it was a really incredible thing that when we landed there i was talking to various people and they were saying to me you've got to get everybody involved here you can't just expect it to work you have to get out and work and we did and we traveled around and we spoke to elders we spoke to doctors we spoke to nurses
JeremyGilley_2011G-0088051-0089232 we have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence and go for a global truce go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities both domestically and internationally ever recorded that's exactly what we must do
JeremyJackson_2010Z-0002751-0003286 and it was really a lot of fun for about ten years i mean
JeremyJackson_2010Z-0017234-0018141 and a lot of seaweed and slime and that's more or less the story of the coral reefs of the caribbean and increasingly tragically
JeremyJackson_2010Z-0028517-0029870 and what have you it's a little hard to understand that because you can go to a costco in the united states and buy cheap fish you ought to read the label to find out where it came from but it's still cheap and everybody thinks it's
JeremyJackson_2010Z-0040874-0041554 put it on a big chain and drag it across the sea floor to stir up the bottom and catch the fish
JeremyJackson_2010Z-0051928-0052629 it's a bit of an embarrassment it was accidentally released from the aquarium in monaco it was
JeremyJackson_2010Z-0065354-0066437 and another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms that picture is just staggering to me i have talked about it a million times
JeremyJackson_2010Z-0077900-0078783 and then of course there's climate change and we all know about climate change and i guess the iconic figure of it is the melting of the ice in the arctic sea
JeremyJackson_2010Z-0092993-0094128 but there are these what we call positive feedbacks the synergies among them that make the whole vastly greater than the sum of the parts and the great scientific challenge
JeremyJackson_2010Z-0107145-0108130 and our greed and our need for growth and our inability to imagine a world which is different from the selfish world we live in today
JessaGamble_2010G-0004692-0005754 it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away
JessaGamble_2010G-0013490-0013933 but of course we've spread to every corner of the globe and in arctic canada where i live
JessaGamble_2010GU-0001903-0003019 life evolved under conditions of light and darkness light and then darkness and so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in
JessaGamble_2010GU-0011456-0012513 so fine we have a body clock and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives it's a huge driver for culture and i think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior
JessaGamble_2010GU-0022808-0022951 but i believe we should
JessiArrington_2011A-0023314-0024765 if you believe you're a beautiful person inside and out there is no look that you can't pull off so there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience we should be able to rock anything we want to rock
JessicaGreen_2011G-0011586-0013351 we looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation in a wing of the building and pry open the windows that were no longer operable but they made them operable for our study and we also sampled the outdoor air if you look at the x axis of this graph
JessicaGreen_2011G-0029507-0030549 i've heard somebody say that you're as healthy as your gut and for this reason many people eat probiotic yogurt so they can promote a healthy gut flora
JessicaGreen_2013U-0016589-0018522 look around the outside of the circle you'll see broad bacterial groups and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group so at twelve o'clock you'll see that offices have a lot of alphaproteobacteria and at one o'clock you'll see that bacilli are relatively rare
JessicaGreen_2013U-0031662-0033078 if you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another they have very similar ecosystems but if you go to an office that is a farther walking distance away the ecosystem is fundamentally different
JessicaGreen_2013U-0045804-0047573 in these rooms the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well and when charlie saw this he got really excited he felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building's resident microbial landscape
JessicaJackley_2010G-0013094-0013932 i saw pictures and images frequently of sadness and suffering i heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor i heard about disease i heard about war
JessicaJackley_2010G-0033240-0034267 it was an amazing sort of insight for me and i in fact was so deeply moved by this it's hard to express now how much that affected me but i was so moved that i actually quit my job a few weeks later
JessicaJackley_2010G-0053364-0054296 they were paid and their businesses in fact grew and they were able to support themselves and change the trajectory of their lives in october of five
JessicaJackley_2010G-0071941-0072822 the first one is as i mentioned entrepreneurship was a new idea to me kiva borrowers as i interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years have taught me what entrepreneurship is and i think at its core
JessicaJackley_2010G-0098126-0098803 to try and to mess up because we care so very much about helping each other and being meaningful in each other's lives so
JiHaePark_2013-0021229-0021539 i started to rediscover
JillBolteTaylor_2008-0005283-0006258 and i moved from my home state of indiana to boston where i was working in the lab of doctor francine benes in the harvard department of psychiatry and
JillBolteTaylor_2008-0013051-0013388 walk talk read write or recall
JillBolteTaylor_2008-0026420-0026577 and what it sounds like
JillBolteTaylor_2008-0036882-0037004 i am
JillBolteTaylor_2008-0052722-0052849 total silence
JillBolteTaylor_2008-0064359-0064505 the next thing my brain says to me
JillBolteTaylor_2008-0075509-0076402 the numbers as i went along and pushed them so that as i would come back to normal reality i'd be able to tell yes i've already dialed that number
JillBolteTaylor_2008-0085015-0085582 when i woke later that afternoon i was shocked to discover that i was still alive
JillBolteTaylor_2008-0095791-0095959 and that they could purposely
JillBolteTaylor_2008-0105174-0105954 from the flow separate from you i am doctor jill bolte taylor intellectual neuroanatomist
JillSobuleMANHATTANINJANUARY_2006-0011923-0011996 and so
JillSobuleandJuliaSweeneySHOW_2007-0013588-0013672 and
JillTarter_2009-0002282-0003246 are we alone the story of humans is the story of ideas scientific ideas that shine light
JillTarter_2009-0016882-0016985 there others are
JillTarter_2009-0026564-0027386 it might be that some massive network of communications or some shield against asteroidal impact or some huge
JillTarter_2009-0039254-0039992 times farther away than the moon or four percent of the distance to the sun so there are many possibilities
JillTarter_2009-0051908-0052739 so ultimately what's going to determine the success or failure of seti is the longevity of technologies
JillTarter_2009-0059529-0060010 life not anticipating its emergence life happened very quickly and that
JillTarter_2009-0065541-0066041 billions of years of evolutionary plotting and planning we are
JillTarter_2009-0080078-0081162 of which we are just a small part and that copernican revolution continues today to influence science and philosophy and technology and theology
JillTarter_2009-0099290-0100243 the twenty fifth anniversary of ted and next month the kepler spacecraft will launch and will begin to tell us just how frequent earth like planets are
JillTarter_2009-0109261-0109452 i wish that you would empower
JillTarter_2009-0121936-0122335 a visionary president stood on the steps of the u s capitol and said
JimFallon_2009-0011794-0012691 and also the interior part of the temporal lobe so there is the pattern that every one of them had but they all were a little different too they had other sorts of brain damage a key thing is
JimFallon_2009-0025458-0026393 my mother said to me i hear you've been going around talking about psychopathic killers and you're talking as if you come from a normal family i said what the hell are you talking about
JimToomey_2010Z-0002525-0003879 not all of them have happy endings so how did i get started cartooning i doodled a lot as a kid and if you spend enough time doodling sooner or later something happens all your career options run out so you have
JimToomey_2010Z-0014000-0014915 up until that day these were the animals that were most common in my life these were the ones i'd like to draw all variations of four legs and
JimToomey_2010Z-0026224-0026645 little bioluminescence here give him a headlight maybe a brake light
JimToomey_2010Z-0042475-0043515 my characters are my lead character's a shark named sherman he's a great white shark and i kind of broke the mold with sherman i didn't want to go with this ruthless predator
JimToomey_2010Z-0061070-0061611 two so i sent them to boise idaho
JimToomey_2010Z-0074148-0074724 and voila next day air they show up and they surgically reattach them i ended that series with a kind of a
JimmyWales_2005G-0014043-0015136 so yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was and i'm going to tell you what the cost of wikipedia is but first i'll show you how big it is so we've got
JimmyWales_2005G-0025259-0026252 you could never afford to do this in a company you could never afford to have a standby crew of people twenty four hours a day and do what we're doing at wikipedia
JimmyWales_2005G-0039041-0039735 this came after i told the reporter that we had to lock it for occasionally a little bit here and there so
JimmyWales_2005G-0051713-0052870 is really important for us because it empowers a community that is very diverse to come together and actually get some work done so we have very diverse contributors in terms of political religious cultural backgrounds
JimmyWales_2005G-0062652-0063742 is that the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very close knit community of maybe six hundred to one thousand people who are in constant communication and we have over forty irc channels forty mailing
JimmyWales_2005G-0069059-0070074 they see that someone an anonymous ip number made an edit to my page that sounds suspicious who is this person somebody looks at it they can immediately see highlighted in red all of the changes that took place
JimmyWales_2005G-0083580-0084508 does an enormous amount of work with vandalism hoaxes and votes for deletion his voice carries a lot of weight within the community because he knows what he's doing
JimmyWales_2005G-0094628-0095441 the point is my role in the community within the free software world there is long there's been a longstanding tradition of
JimmyWales_2005G-0109005-0109335 thank you
JinhaLee_2013-0010691-0011065 and grab pixels with your bare hands
JinhaLee_2013-0023548-0024186 students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion
JinsopLee_2013-0014227-0015196 so i decided to evaluate different experiences i had in my life from the point of view of the five senses to do this i devised something called the five senses graph
JinsopLee_2013-0032625-0033878 now you can see not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close in fact in the years that i gathered data only one experience came close to being the perfect one that is of course sex
JinsopLee_2013-0043299-0043749 and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009-0006828-0007692 but first a little bit about this group of artists scientists and engineers that are working together i'm a composer orchestrally trained and the inventor of the allosphere
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009-0017343-0018358 for artists we're making new worlds that we can uncover and explore as these generative algorithms grow over time they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects
JoAnnKucheraMorin_2009-0027664-0029011 the white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three orbital configuration in a minute we're going to move to a two orbital configuration
JoachimdePosada_2009U-0005547-0006258 to tell a four year old kid to wait fifteen minutes for something that they like is equivalent to telling us we'll bring you
JoachimdePosada_2009U-0015997-0017175 i had a question in my mind would hispanic kids react the same way as the american kids so i went to colombia and i reproduced the experiment and it was very funny i used four five and six years old kids and
JoanHalifax_2010W-0008581-0008782 i looked into
JoanHalifax_2010W-0023614-0023809 i know those hands and eyes
JoanHalifax_2010W-0031064-0031939 we actually aspire to transform suffering and if we're so blessed we engage in activities that transform suffering
JoanHalifax_2010W-0035337-0035995 would distort deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the whole catastrophe
JoanHalifax_2010W-0049415-0050192 another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what's called neural integration it hooks up all parts of the brain
JoanHalifax_2010W-0067371-0068436 they have infused societies with kindness and we have really felt that as woman after woman has stood on this stage in the past day and a half
JoanHalifax_2010W-0077496-0078045 may we actualize that capacity for women everywhere thank you
JodyWilliams_2010W-0007661-0007801 and health care
JodyWilliams_2010W-0014472-0014988 of the world secure to make the people of the world secure
JodyWilliams_2010W-0024134-0024289 i was in hiroshima
JodyWilliams_2010W-0035061-0035260 but i don't believe in hope
JodyWilliams_2010W-0041861-0042014 is very creative
JodyWilliams_2010W-0049610-0050082 they work together they will ultimately bring change in their own country
JodyWilliams_2010W-0059741-0060652 some of the people who worked in our campaign could only work maybe an hour a month they could maybe volunteer that much there were others like myself who were full time
JoeDeRisi_2006-0008673-0009751 and so we looked into this a little more carefully and i'm going to show you data now this is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop i took a bunch of these small picornaviruses like the common cold like polio and so on
JoeDeRisi_2006-0020685-0022003 ok i make little robots in lab to make these chips and i'm really big on disseminating technology if you've got enough money to buy just a camry you can build one of these too and so we put a deep how to guide on the web
JoeDeRisi_2006-0035777-0037061 right i can see a rhinovirus and here's the blow up of the rhinovirus's little barcode but what about different rhinoviruses how do i know which rhinovirus i have there's one hundred and two known variants of the common cold and there's only one hundred and two because people got bored collecting them
JoeDeRisi_2006-0056010-0056869 the genetic relationships are very close there that's a lot of fun so we built out the chip we made a chip that has every known virus ever discovered on it
JoeDeRisi_2006-0072471-0073408 and viral assay you can buy off the shelf sars metapneumovirus hiv rsv all these everything came back negative over one hundred thousand dollars worth of tests
JoeDeRisi_2006-0080865-0081639 there are folks that are predisposed to it and the first gene that was mapped in association studies for this early onset prostate cancer
JoeDeRisi_2006-0086299-0086422 ok that's pretty wild
JoeSabia_2011S-0006781-0007592 he grabbed his pen he snatched his scissors this man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold
JoeSabia_2011S-0019933-0020163 and they remembered a man
JoelLevine_2009X-0001691-0002413 about four point six billion years of history in eighteen minutes that's three hundred million
JoelLevine_2009X-0021694-0022394 is there water on mars the answer is no there is no liquid water on the surface of mars today but
JoelLevine_2009X-0032267-0033030 ocean area on the surface of mars where did the oceans worth of water on mars go well we have an idea
JoelLevine_2009X-0042852-0043720 the oldest rock on earth is only three point six billion the reason there is a billion year gap in our geological understanding
JoelLevine_2009X-0052633-0053895 ten years ago we invited ten of the top mars scientists to the langley research center for two days we addressed on the board the major questions that have not been
JoelLevine_2009X-0064141-0064697 we produce the next generation of scientists engineers mathematicians and technologists
JoelLevine_2009X-0076488-0077386 opens up to slow it down the thermal tiles fall off the airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time
JoelLevine_2009X-0091322-0092166 with jet propulsion laboratory goddard space flight center ames research center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this
JoelSelanikio_2013X-0008206-0008828 the data that would help us solve the problems we're trying to solve is not actually present on the internet
JoelSelanikio_2013X-0019243-0020578 sometimes tens of thousands of doors sometimes it takes months to even years to do something like this you know a census of indonesia would probably take two years to accomplish and the problem of course with all of this is that
JoelSelanikio_2013X-0031418-0032733 diseases for which the vaccine costs a dollar and millions of children die of these diseases every year and the fact is millions is a gross estimate because we don't really know how many kids die each year of this
JoelSelanikio_2013X-0049026-0049354 but the problem is twenty or thirty programs
JoelSelanikio_2013X-0059310-0060232 and this is a problem for which we need to scale this technology and we need to scale it now and so i began to think of ways in which i could basically take myself out of the picture
JoelSelanikio_2013X-0067932-0069318 i need to think about this some more while i was thinking about it people started using even more things just like this just as we were they started using linkedin and flickr and gmail and google maps all these things of course all of these things are cloud based
JoelSelanikio_2013X-0073396-0075015 you can create forms and once you've created the forms you push them to a variety of common mobile phones obviously nowadays we've moved past palm pilots to mobile phones and it doesn't have to be a smartphone it can be a basic phone like the phone on the right there you know the basic kind of symbian phone that's very common in developing countries
JoelSelanikio_2013X-0086449-0086823 so that they can bring the perpetrators to justice
JohanRockstroem_2010G-0004182-0004443 that business as usual is not an option
JohanRockstroem_2010G-0016197-0017831 the majority of the environmental impacts on the planet have been caused by the rich minority the twenty percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon in the mid eighteenth century the majority of the planet aspiring for development having the right for development are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle a momentous pressure
JohanRockstroem_2010G-0029937-0030345 and i can tell you you enter the disciplinary research in each of these
JohanRockstroem_2010G-0041540-0042114 in my mind the largest red flag warning for humanity that we are in a precarious situation
JohanRockstroem_2010G-0055522-0055719 record of the history of the planet
JohanRockstroem_2010G-0069336-0070646 operates as if we're only on a dark straight highway now the question then is how gloomy is this is then sustainable development utopia well there's no science to suggest in fact there is
JohanRockstroem_2010G-0077175-0079122 doing that at any scale on governance but is it happening anywhere do we have any examples of success on this mind shift being applied at the local level well yes in fact we do and the list can start becoming longer and longer there's good news here for example from latin america where plow based
JohanRockstroem_2010G-0086405-0087949 and then allow for much more redundancy in the system sweden the country i come from has other examples where wetlands in southern sweden were seen as as in many countries as flood prone polluted nuisance in the peri urban regions but again
JohanRockstroem_2010G-0098309-0098741 policy measure feed in tariffs on the energy system which is already applied from china
JohanRockstrom_2010G-0010017-0010837 this is the environmental conditions on the planet here used as a proxy temperature variability it was a jumpy ride eighty thousand years back in a crisis we leave africa
JohanRockstrom_2010G-0024329-0025612 human pressure on the planet of momentous scale we may in fact have entered a new geological era the anthropocene where humans are the predominant driver of change at a planetary level
JohanRockstrom_2010G-0037989-0038795 loses its resilience soft corals take over and we get undesired systems that cannot support economic and social development the arctic
JohanRockstrom_2010G-0049954-0051166 to keep ourselves safe in the holocene and could we even thanks to major advancements in earth systems science identify the thresholds the points where we may expect nonlinear change and could we even
JohanRockstrom_2010G-0069801-0071234 now the question then is how gloomy is this is then sustainable development utopia well there's no science to suggest in fact there is ample science to indicate that we can do this transformative change that we have the ability
JohanRockstrom_2010G-0085226-0085866 but the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset which today has led to a completely new governance strategy to build resilience
JohanRockstrom_2010G-0095540-0096141 local action based partnerships and cross scale institutional innovations
JohanRockstrom_2010G-0102789-0103617 our future and we say what is the playing field on the planet what are the planetary boundaries within which we can safely operate and then backtrack
JohannaBlakley_2009X-0006413-0006647 that this is illegal for her to do this
JohannaBlakley_2009X-0022013-0023292 now fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry this wedding dress here is actually made of sporks and this dress is actually made of aluminum
JohannaBlakley_2009X-0035339-0035571 you know a knock off is never the same
JohannaBlakley_2009X-0057846-0058238 but the novelty standard is so high you have to prove that your garment
JohannaBlakley_2009X-0067089-0067431 you know it's not just the fashion industry that doesn't have copyright protection
JohannaBlakley_2009X-0076031-0076247 you talk to people in the fashion industry and they're like
JohannaBlakley_2009X-0087984-0088105 now the conceptual issues are
JohannaBlakley_2010W-0006809-0007826 they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences it's old school demographics they come up with these very restrictive labels to define us
JohannaBlakley_2010W-0017356-0018249 all the people who participate in social media networks belong to the same old demographic categories that media companies and advertisers have used in order to understand
JohannaBlakley_2010W-0030413-0031591 if you look at the statistics these are worldwide statistics in every single age category women actually outnumber men in their use of social networking technologies
JohannaBlakley_2010W-0040812-0042014 the future entertainment media that we're going to see is going to be very data driven and it's going to be based on the information that we ascertain from taste communities online where women are really driving the action
JohannaBlakley_2010X-0007619-0007795 but no copyright protection and no patent protection
JohannaBlakley_2010X-0025013-0026627 some people believe that there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain who sort of dictate to us what we're all going to wear but if you talk to any designer at any level including these high end designers they always say their main inspiration comes from the street
JohannaBlakley_2010X-0039476-0040499 global trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to and this actually is good news to trendsetters they want trends to be set so that they can move product
JohannaBlakley_2010X-0058250-0059597 has never existed before it's totally unique and that's sort of like the novelty standard for a u s patent which fashion designers never get rarely get here in the states in the european union they went in the other direction
JohannaBlakley_2010X-0065826-0065996 who owns a look
JohannaBlakley_2010X-0070496-0071652 magic tricks i think they're instructions sort of like recipes no copyright protection hairdos no copyright protection open source software these guys decided they didn't want copyright protection
JohannaBlakley_2010X-0090377-0091523 in a digital world that's going to lead to the most innovation and my suggestion is that fashion might be a really good place to start looking for a model for creative industries in the future
JohnBohannon_2011X-0010427-0010675 the control of a laser is so precise that you can
JohnBohannon_2011X-0019997-0020281 now of course the moment that it does hit the outside environment
JohnBohannon_2011X-0033004-0034471 but just as quickly as they explode more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer so it's constantly changing just to remain exactly the same now david builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab but before he does that
JohnBohannon_2011X-0049916-0050247 which i hope will not be liable to the least objection
JohnDelaney_2010Z-0006570-0007538 was a brilliant man he said more with less than any human that i have ever read or talked to
JohnDelaney_2010Z-0020801-0022223 so what scientists do when they begin is to start with the system they define what the system is the system isn't chesapeake bay it's not the caro arc it's not even the entire pacific it's the whole planet the entire planet continents and oceans
JohnDelaney_2010Z-0036552-0037588 of order a billion people on the planet currently are undernourished or starving and part of the issue is for cody
JohnDelaney_2010Z-0053470-0054495 rival the total amount of living biomass at the surface of the planet it's an astonishing insight and we have only found out about this recently this is very very exciting
JohnDelaney_2010Z-0068616-0069403 most of them right here but the one on the west coast that's in the box is called the regional scale nodes and it was once called neptune
JohnDelaney_2010Z-0085016-0086090 massive amounts of data flowing ashore all available to anyone who has any interest in using it this is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location
JohnDelaney_2010Z-0097809-0098622 as a result of the human genome process we are in a situation where events that take place in the ocean like an erupting volcano or something of that sort
JohnDelaney_2010Z-0116046-0116443 many of you don't think of this yet but the ocean will be in your pocket
JohnDoerr_2007-0005585-0005817 i'm scared and i'm angry
JohnDoerr_2007-0015693-0016742 i want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that and four lessons i've learned in the last year the first lesson is that companies are really powerful and that matters a lot
JohnDoerr_2007-0022077-0022875 these are really simple smart solutions based on existing technology why does wal mart matter well it's massive
JohnDoerr_2007-0027614-0028092 the second thing that we learned is that individuals matter and they matter enormously
JohnDoerr_2007-0036101-0036228 i don't know and i should
JohnDoerr_2007-0045355-0045782 thank you i think it's the most important legislation of two thousand and six why
JohnDoerr_2007-0061467-0062751 too much for africa so a team of berkeley researchers with fifteen million dollars from the gates foundation is engineering designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient called
JohnDoerr_2007-0075459-0076205 you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply america's energy needs for the next thousand years
JohnDoerr_2007-0090053-0091000 tell you what green technologies going green is bigger than the internet it could be the biggest economic opportunity of the twenty one st century moreover if we succeed
JohnDoerr_2007-0101790-0102354 that we multiply all of our energy all of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem
JohnFrancis_2008-0015380-0015629 collide beneath the golden gate and
JohnFrancis_2008-0024379-0024462 mothers
JohnFrancis_2008-0034093-0035178 and i needed to learn more so for a year i said i would keep quiet and then on my birthday i would reassess what i had learned and maybe i would talk again well that lasted seventeen years
JohnFrancis_2008-0041543-0041886 but what are you going to do with a bachelor a s degree you don a t ride in cars you don a t talk you
JohnFrancis_2008-0051704-0052383 they don a t do that in graduate schools i don a t think but i use that story because they really wanted to help me
JohnFrancis_2008-0068630-0069448 ninety the twentieth anniversary of earth day that a s when i began to speak and that a s why i said thank you for being here because it's sort of like that tree in the forest
JohnFrancis_2008-0078046-0078609 one year's enough for me to do that i got on a sailboat and i sailed down to the caribbean and
JohnFrancis_2008-0090909-0091106 the road turned into the jungle
JohnFrancis_2008-0098455-0098774 and that i was going to have to change you know we can do it
JohnFrancis_2008-0101675-0102713 and i know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we a ve gotten to but there a s another place for us to go and we
JohnFrancis_2008-0106171-0106366 we have to change now
JohnFrancis_2008-0111688-0112082 is really how we a re going to treat the environment
JohnGerzema_2009X-0012142-0013591 this is something i call the fifty twenty paradox it took us fifty years to reach annual savings ratings of almost ten percent fifty years do you know what this was right here this was world war ii do you know why savings was so high
JohnGerzema_2009X-0029032-0029717 dentists report molars you know people grinding their teeth coming in and reporting the fact that they've had stress and so there is an increase
JohnGerzema_2009X-0046465-0047356 this movement forward from dollars and cents what businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets is really interesting a couple things that are kind of cool one is that frito lay
JohnGerzema_2009X-0064440-0065447 we also see the fact that libraries have become a huge resource for america did you know that sixty eight percent of americans now carry a library card the highest percentage ever in our nation's history
JohnGerzema_2009X-0081990-0083224 then we also look at the idea of cow pooling which is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together to buy meat from organic farms that they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled
JohnGerzema_2009X-0095551-0096611 what we're seeing with consumers right now is the ability for them to actually lead us forward out of this recession so we believe that values driven spending will force capitalism to be better
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X-0008180-0010079 i really miss that era you know where you could go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer get demonstrated to you laughter but babbage babbage himself was born at the end of the eighteenth century and was a fairly famous mathematician he held the post that newton held at cambridge and that was recently held by stephen hawking
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X-0019140-0020743 this monstrosity over here is the cpu the chip if you like of course it's this big completely mechanical this whole machine is mechanical this is a picture of a prototype for part of the cpu which is in the science museum
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X-0041307-0041999 i know the solution mathematics is the solution we'll teach her mathematics that'll calm her down laughter because of course
JohnGrahamCumming_2012X-0067622-0068768 humongous thing and say ah i see the memory operating i see the cpu operating i hear it operating i probably smell it operating laughter but in between that we're going to do a simulation
JohnHardy_2010G-0010789-0011444 a wonderful life there and we decided to do something unusual we decided to give
JohnHardy_2010G-0022326-0023538 we pay the bill at the end of the month but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren we have to teach the kids that the world is not indestructible
JohnHardy_2010G-0032398-0033818 the teachers dragged giant pvc whiteboards into the classrooms so we had some good ideas we took old automobile windshields put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard
JohnHardy_2010G-0043861-0045131 we manage to keep the garden that was there running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms we dropped them gently in we made space for these guys who are bali's last black pigs
JohnHardy_2010G-0055140-0055984 a lot of outrageous things in our lives and we said okay local what does local mean local means that twenty percent of the population of the school has to
JohnHardy_2010G-0063241-0064279 it comes out of the ground like a train it grows as high as a coconut tree in two months and three years later it can be harvested to build buildings like this
JohnHardy_2010G-0068827-0069628 big models we had them engineered by the engineers and balinese carpenters like this measured them with their bamboo rulers
JohnHockenberry_2012-0004781-0005555 design bad design there's just no excuse for it it's letting stuff happen without thinking about it every object
JohnHockenberry_2012-0018817-0019064 a wheelchair is a very difficult object
JohnHockenberry_2012-0038552-0038853 something radically different
JohnHockenberry_2012-0047546-0047771 now here's an example a little closer to home
JohnHockenberry_2012-0056894-0058807 yes and after a couple very liberating weekends my wife and i utilizing some cutting edge erectile technology that is certainly worthy of a tedtalk someday but i won't get into it now we noticed some familiar if unexpected symptoms
JohnHockenberry_2012-0066866-0067413 but there were some lessons even there this guy plato it turns out he's a designer
JohnHockenberry_2012-0074587-0075037 the given was replaced by various aspects of intent
JohnHockenberry_2012-0086462-0087037 i was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of zaire completely invisible
JohnHockenberry_2012-0095484-0096238 we spoke for a few minutes and then each of us vanished back into the chaos he went back to the streets of kinshasa i went to my hotel
JohnHockenberry_2012-0102302-0102524 but the nurse was already there with an answer
JohnHodgman_2008-0004487-0005239 the supposed flying saucer crash at roswell new mexico and even though that turned out to be nothing nothing at all
JohnHodgman_2008-0017344-0017839 that he asked for only one thing a gift of two healthy sperm whales
JohnHodgman_2008-0029311-0030095 i was pretty good at the video games i was not very good at the other part so i stayed alone with the cosmos and that's when it
JohnHodgman_2008-0040895-0041628 the old man reached out his knobbly claw for the woman's hand and found it and left me alone
JohnHodgman_2008-0052916-0053507 there was a character called the third stage guild navigator which was a kind of giant floating fetus
JohnHodgman_2008-0058353-0059024 it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again when i say it out loud it sounds so ridiculous
JohnHodgman_2008-0066966-0067735 and we decided apropos of nothing to go see this movie and the way i remember it the movie featured these details one
JohnHodgman_2008-0076992-0077699 for what it's worth we went to sagres which was considered at the time to be the end of the world and there i was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the
JohnHodgman_2008-0086148-0086296 i did not know where the beach was
JohnHodgman_2012-0001639-0002027 i'm going to unpack for you three examples of iconic
JohnHodgman_2012-0016447-0016870 innovation and its promise of imminent violence
JohnHodgman_2012-0027810-0028873 no i have an iphone of course i do here is my well loved iphone i do so many things on this little device i like to read books on it more than that i like to buy books on it
JohnHunter_2011-0007809-0008070 and she told me she said you know i grew up
JohnHunter_2011-0026294-0027638 was teaching many years later and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker his name is chris farina chris farina is here today at his own cost chris could you stand up and let them see you a young visionary filmmaker who's made
JohnHunter_2011-0039323-0039850 and my mother who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in virginia
JohnHunter_2011-0055141-0055339 and so with all these crises
JohnHunter_2011-0069664-0069974 fix it for us and maybe this game will help you learn how to do
JohnHunter_2011-0093224-0093480 by the third sentence she was in tears
JohnHunter_2011-0113066-0114995 that was unexpected and unpredictable every game we play is different some games are more about social issues some are more about economic issues some games are more about warfare but i don't try to deny them that reality of being human i allow them to go there and through their own experience learn in a bloodless way
JohnKasaona_2010-0003803-0004189 these days they talk about famine hiv and
JohnKasaona_2010-0009939-0010038 and time have
JohnKasaona_2010-0015882-0015988 and smack it on the
JohnKasaona_2010-0021865-0022091 in addition to being a himba i'm also
JohnKasaona_2010-0026247-0026441 for control over my country and
JohnKasaona_2010-0035239-0035421 they actually spend a lot of
JohnKasaona_2010-0044235-0044645 with independence the whole approach of community getting involved was embraced by
JohnKasaona_2010-0048988-0049880 i think is much easier than talking through a spirit that you can't see isn't it and these things we were taught by outsiders we learned these things from
JohnKasaona_2010-0055810-0056124 brought back into the communities and they were made part of the
JohnKasaona_2010-0063703-0064226 been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs
JohnKasaona_2010-0072921-0073110 this other thing has multiplied from
JohnKasaona_2010-0079094-0079584 based on the respect of our natural resources and we are able to use this money for many things
JohnKasaona_2010-0088842-0089046 much more than just a healthy
JohnLaGrou_2009-0008486-0009457 any electrical device an appliance an extension cord whatever must be able to tell the power outlet hey power outlet i'm drawing too much current shut me off
JohnLaGrou_2009-0020668-0021411 three weeks ago we received our first international recognition the two thousand and nine ces innovation award
JohnLloyd_2009G-0008625-0008765 so everything that matters
JohnLloyd_2009G-0022899-0023226 so that's why we don't think it exists the sufi masters working on us
JohnLloyd_2009G-0037471-0037609 that makes you who you are
JohnLloyd_2009G-0056427-0056627 and what should we do about it while we are
JohnMaeda_2007-0012700-0013054 so it was traumatizing actually so
JohnMaeda_2007-0020825-0021400 last year at ted these were all my titles i had a lot of titles i have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters
JohnMaeda_2007-0026526-0027014 so i loved going to school school was great and maybe going to school helped me get to this media lab place
JohnMaeda_2007-0043227-0044319 wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this i had clients in japan to make really complex stuff like this and i've always felt bad about it in a sense so i hid in a time dimension
JohnMaeda_2007-0057817-0058300 measure the impact stuff like this are things i made just to sort of understand what these things are
JohnMaeda_2007-0069053-0069847 a strange business model i can come into work everyday and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte end of story but
JohnMaeda_2007-0089958-0091152 and if you have your vision vision is interesting as you age from infant age your vision gets better and maybe in your late teens early twenties you're looking for a mate and your vision goes after that
JohnMaeda_2008P-0008097-0008708 and you see this era coincided with my own childhood i grew up in a tofu factory in seattle
JohnMaeda_2008P-0024313-0025150 and the problem when you're younger for all you students out there is your head gets kind of big really easy and when i was making icons i was like
JohnMaeda_2012G-0018306-0018615 wonder about computers and technology in general
JohnMaeda_2012G-0040293-0040981 and i can add in a blue gradient and a dove and i have like don draper free laughter so
JohnMaeda_2012G-0068288-0069561 he realized it isn't about old or new it's about something in between it isn't about old the dirt new the cloud it's about what is good a combination of the cloud
JohnMaeda_2012G-0084095-0085317 leaders what we do is we connect improbable connections and hope something will happen and in that room i found so many connections between people across all of london and so
JohnMaeda_2012G-0096567-0097760 and i believe that this kind of perspective will only begin to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design because art and design lets you think like this
JohnMcWhorter_2013-0011603-0012911 you can do things with language that are much less likely if you're just talking for example imagine a passage from edward gibbon's the decline and fall of the roman empire
JohnMcWhorter_2013-0024670-0025459 the point of it was to listen to him speaking like writing ordinary people stood and listened to that for two hours it was perfectly natural
JohnMcWhorter_2013-0036742-0038564 and in order to understand it what we want to see is the way in this new kind of language there is new structure coming up and so for example there is in texting a convention which is
JohnMcWhorter_2013-0058555-0059016 so we have a whole battery of new constructions that are developing
JohnMcWhorter_2013-0069531-0070519 that what we're seeing is a whole new way of writing that young people are developing which they're using alongside their ordinary writing skills and that means
JohnSearle_2013-0004356-0005546 the second reason is that when people do get interested in it as i think they should they tend to say the most appalling things and then even when they're not saying appalling things and they're really trying to do serious research
JohnSearle_2013-0020708-0021740 rainbows are illusions so consciousness is an illusion two well maybe it exists but it's really something else it's a computer program running in the brain
JohnSearle_2013-0034079-0035259 and just as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid depending on the behavior of the molecules so your brain can go from a state of being conscious to a state of being unconscious
JohnSearle_2013-0047136-0049071 namely conscious states are by definition subjective in the sense that they only exist as experienced by some human or animal subject some self that experiences them maybe we'll be able to build a conscious machine since we don't know how our brains do it we're not in a position so far to build a conscious machine
JohnSearle_2013-0063280-0063609 influence and may still be around and that is
JohnSearle_2013-0078512-0079184 you can have a completely objective science a science where you make objectively true claims
JohnSearle_2013-0087530-0088769 consciousness has to become accepted as a genuine biological phenomenon as much subject to scientific analysis as any other phenomenon in biology or for that matter the rest of science thank you very much
JohnUnderkoffler_2010-0019848-0020735 this little design experiment that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well if you presented it with a chess board it tried to figure out what you might mean by that
JohnUnderkoffler_2010-0036333-0037108 fifty four that we were painting in the film be believable that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an r d effort and the
JohnUnderkoffler_2010-0047998-0048671 so now we've got the stuff color sorted angle maps onto color and now if we want to select
JohnUnderkoffler_2010-0058471-0059851 have to work together and we have many different displays and we might want to look at these various images we might want to ask for some help the author of this new pointing device is sitting over there so i can
JohnUnderkoffler_2010-0070893-0071031 we may need more than one
JohnUnderkoffler_2010-0088830-0089618 do all the big data intensive data heavy problems with it so whether it's logistics and supply chain management or natural gas and resource extraction
JohnWalker_2007P-0008689-0009520 japan and this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high definition and we were able to cross this line called the uncanny valley in terms of
JohnWalker_2007P-0043283-0044183 and then you heard the original ultimately i started with the experience and the experience is i want to be in the room and hear the musicians lots of you can afford to buy one of these
JohnWalker_2007P-0059164-0059183 the
JohnWalker_2007P-0062671-0063684 because what you've just heard was a computer playing data no glenn gould in the room but yet it was human and i believe you'll get to the next step the real dream of
JohnWalker_2007P-0072683-0073667 and every note every beat every slur every accent every pedal was perfect because he played it for that room on that day and we captured all that data all over again
JohnWilbanks_2012G-0017461-0018728 it's something that protects us from harm from hucksters from people that would try to hoodwink us into a clinical study that we don't understand or that we don't agree to and so you put together the thread
JohnWilbanks_2012G-0035566-0037210 we cannot take the information from past trials and put them together to form statistically significant samples and that sucks right so forty five percent of men develop cancer thirty eight percent of women develop cancer one in four men dies of cancer
JohnWilbanks_2012G-0060261-0061890 and although a lot of people like privacy as their methodology of control around data and obsess around privacy at least some of us really like to share as a form of control and what's remarkable about digital commonses is you don't need a big percentage if your sample size is big enough to generate something massive and beautiful
JohnWilbanks_2012G-0073609-0074675 if you reach into the medical system and somehow extract your medical record you can actually go through an online informed consent process because the donation to the commons must be voluntary and it must be informed
JohnWilbanks_2012G-0090948-0092364 but if you do or if you've been sick then maybe you would and we're going to be able to do an experiment in the next several months that lets us know exactly how many unreasonable people are out there so this is the athena breast health network it's a study of one hundred and fifty thousand women in california
JohnWooden_2001-0010924-0011837 in the classroom or more points in some athletic contest i thought about that for quite a spell and i wanted to come up with my own definition i thought that might help
JohnWooden_2001-0022919-0023643 the previous speaker that i enjoy poetry and i dabble in it a bit and love it there are some things that helped me i think
JohnWooden_2001-0033800-0034644 i may not see the church or hear the word or eat the food their hands may grow but yet again i may and later i may say i knew him once
JohnWooden_2001-0044814-0045523 i wouldn't let him go he couldn't get on the bus he had to go home and get cleaned up to get to the airport so i
JohnWooden_2001-0059134-0059948 not just give it word service believe that things will work out as they should providing we do what we should i think our tendency is to hope
JohnWooden_2001-0073866-0074802 and you can win when you're outscored i've felt that way on certain occasions at various times and i just wanted them to be able to hold their head
JohnWooden_2001-0090241-0090729 i wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside i wanted them to be good inside too
JohnWooden_2001-0099572-0099967 but they get kept good position and so they did well rebounding they remembered that
JohnnyLee_2008-0011033-0012069 got a battery a button and an infrared led and it turns on you guys can't see it but it turns on whenever i push the button now what this means is that if i run this piece of software
JohnnyLee_2008-0025500-0026680 because this is about ten dollars of additional hardware if you already have a nintendo wii so i'm looking forward to seeing some games and actually louis castle that's him down there last week announced that electronic arts one of the largest game
JokChurch_2007-0008267-0008890 i had a thumb i had eighty five dollars and i ended up in san francisco california
JokChurch_2007-0013316-0014169 we took a look at her we laughed we cried and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice we found her one we got her there
JonNguyen_2011X-0009627-0010828 but one thing we like to say in our group is we do the opposite of google earth google earth goes from this view down to your backyard we go from this view out to the stars
JonNguyen_2011X-0021456-0021639 nasa's dead that the
JonNguyen_2011X-0039151-0040892 underneath saturn now what happens is as it flies underneath saturn saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up and out of the solar system so if i just keep letting this go you can see voyager one fly up like that
JonRonson_2012-0031681-0032469 because it would make me feel more normal and i said where'd you get that from he said oh from a biography of ted bundy that they had at the prison library
JonRonson_2012-0054466-0055094 although that figure rises to four percent of ceo's and business leaders
JonRonson_2012-0082882-0083333 and then i realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had turned
JonasEliasson_2012X-0005114-0006006 and then you have the emerging world cities with a mixed variety of vehicles mixed land use patterns also rather dispersed but often with a very dense urban core
JonasEliasson_2012X-0026976-0028224 it's now six and a half years ago since the congestion charges were introduced in stockholm and we basically have the same low traffic levels still but you see there's an interesting gap here in the time series in two thousand and seven
JonasGahrStore_2011X-0002573-0003617 our ability to address modern conflicts as they are to go to the source of what they're all about and to understand the key players and to deal with them
JonasGahrStore_2011X-0015507-0015958 either you were with us or against us it was black or white
JonasGahrStore_2011X-0026848-0028083 everybody seems to agree with that it was very controversial to say three four five years ago now everybody agrees but now as we prepare to talk we understand how little we know
JonasGahrStore_2011X-0043776-0045636 but talking can be done in different ways we make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion there's a big array of the ways of dealing with this
JonasGahrStore_2011X-0059064-0059365 supported by technology which is available to all
JonasGahrStore_2011X-0075357-0075763 of communities what is it that makes people trust each other
JonasGahrStore_2011X-0087988-0088878 so there are many reasons and for all of these reasons this is time and this is why we must talk thank you for your attention
JonathanDrori_2007U-0009768-0010099 the third question is why is it hotter in summer than in winter
JonathanDrori_2007U-0013876-0015402 from all the things that go on between them and their peers and their carers and their parents and all of that experience and one of the great experts in this field of course was bless him cardinal wolsey
JonathanDrori_2007U-0034320-0034993 so why is it hotter in summer than in winter we learn as children that you get closer to something that's hot and it burns you
JonathanDrori_2007U-0060891-0061599 then you won't be able to shift them right and i probably haven't shifted your ideas of how the world and universe operates either
JonathanDrori_2009U-0010645-0011408 is by storing seeds because seeds in all their diverse glory are plants futures
JonathanDrori_2009U-0023621-0024110 and this is a distributed network so all around the world people are doing the same thing
JonathanDrori_2010U-0001686-0002999 i have two missions here today the first is to tell you something about pollen i hope and to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose and secondly to convince you that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope
JonathanDrori_2010U-0026758-0028644 all this diversity means that you can look at a pollen grain and tell what species it came from and that's actually quite handy if you maybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from so different species of plants grow in different places and some pollen carries further than others
JonathanDrori_2011S-0001801-0002233 you know how many species of flowering plants there are
JonathanDrori_2011S-0012957-0014405 so we're aware obviously of the relationship between insects and plants there's a symbiotic relationship there whether it's flies or birds or bees they're getting something in return and that something in return is generally nectar
JonathanDrori_2011S-0023060-0024879 that nectar tube to get to the nectar and darwin said looking at this flower i guess something has coevolved with this and sure enough there's the insect and i mean normally it kind of rolls it away but in its erect form that's what it looks like
JonathanDrori_2011S-0039634-0041538 this one's clever it's called obsidian i think of it as insidium sometimes to the right species of bee this looks like another very aggressive bee and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away and of course covers itself with pollen the other thing it does is that this plant mimics
JonathanDrori_2011S-0066977-0067939 last week i took these pictures of rock rose helianthemum in dorset these are little yellow flowers like we all see little yellow flowers all over the place
JonathanEisen_2012P-0009650-0010500 medicine and people have focused on quite a bit the microbes that do bad things and that's where i need my assistant here now
JonathanEisen_2012P-0024726-0025812 ten maybe fifteen years is maybe these microbes this microbial cloud in and on us and the variation between us may be responsible for some of the health
JonathanEisen_2012P-0034730-0035514 which is filled with microbes from a donor and they have a recipient who might have a problem with their microbial community say crohn's disease
JonathanEisen_2012P-0051807-0052086 the microbial community so
JonathanEisen_2012P-0063727-0064398 fecal transplants where rather than delivering a couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth
JonathanEisen_2012P-0069924-0070806 and we do not want to mess with it say by c sections or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness
JonathanEisen_2012P-0079151-0079523 and i was getting up every five minutes to pee
JonathanFoley_2010X-0006172-0007670 but let's go back and drop it a little deeper and look during the daytime what we see during the day is our landscapes this is part of the amazon basin a place called rondonia in the south center part of the brazilian amazon
JonathanFoley_2010X-0023027-0024034 the second area in brown is the world's pastures and rangelands where our animals live that area's about thirty million square kilometers or about an africa's worth of land
JonathanFoley_2010X-0034663-0035643 now a lot you will remember this from your geography classes this is in the former soviet union in between kazakhstan and uzbekistan one of the great inland seas of the world
JonathanFoley_2010X-0052186-0053751 if you look at carbon dioxide from burning tropical rainforest or methane coming from cows and rice or nitrous oxide from too many fertilizers it turns out agriculture is thirty percent of the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere from human activity
JonathanFoley_2010X-0063978-0065461 so more people eating more stuff and richer stuff and of course having an energy crisis at the same time where we have to replace oil with other energy sources that will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels and bio energy sources
JonathanFoley_2010X-0082173-0082594 so what we have to do i think is invent a new kind of agriculture
JonathanHaidt_2008-0011501-0012014 this trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join so here's the description of a group i found on the web
JonathanHaidt_2008-0021971-0022093 by simple stupidity
JonathanHaidt_2008-0039496-0040526 this probably comes from our long history of tribal living of tribal psychology and this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable that even when we don't have tribes we go ahead and make them because it's fun
JonathanHaidt_2008-0051834-0052960 so as you see people care about harm and care issues they give high endorsement of these sorts of statements all across the board but as you also see liberals care about it a little more than conservatives the line slopes down same story for fairness
JonathanHaidt_2008-0067278-0067617 timeless truth that order tends to decay
JonathanHaidt_2008-0083536-0084499 if you can have sub groups and if those sub groups have some internal structure and if you have some ideology that tells people to suppress their carnality to pursue higher nobler ends
JonathanHaidt_2008-0100323-0100787 stop with this struggle of for and against no absolutely not i'm not saying that
JonathanHaidt_2012-0002604-0003283 let's see i'd say about three or four percent i had no idea there were so many believers at a ted conference
JonathanHaidt_2012-0013703-0013854 appearing to say to me
JonathanHaidt_2012-0019214-0020561 others use dancing spinning and circling to promote self transcendence but you don't need a religion to get you through the staircase lots of people find self transcendence in nature others overcome their self at raves
JonathanHaidt_2012-0029675-0030711 this idea that we move up was central in the writing of the great french sociologist emile durkheim durkheim even called us homo duplex or two level man
JonathanHaidt_2012-0039951-0040145 i'm saying we are homo duplex
JonathanHaidt_2012-0046212-0046722 and after all how could it ever be good for us to lose ourselves
JonathanHaidt_2012-0054516-0055405 you've got competition going on within groups and across groups so here's a group of guys on a college crew team within this team
JonathanHaidt_2012-0066681-0067558 and in short order the cooperators are done for the free riders have taken over if a group cannot solve the free rider problem
JonathanHaidt_2012-0075445-0076051 what i've shown you here is sometimes called a major transition in evolutionary history
JonathanHaidt_2012-0087196-0087457 look at the people in these photos i've been showing you
JonathanHaidt_2012-0100763-0101373 nowadays we fly around like individual bees exulting in our freedom but sometimes we
JonathanHaidt_2012S-0009517-0010016 of course the left wants to take action but the right denies that there's any problem
JonathanHaidt_2012S-0022194-0022441 we are doomed unless we start
JonathanHaidt_2012S-0035501-0037174 the circling blinds them it causes them to distort reality we begin separating everything into good versus evil now that process feels great it feels really satisfying but it is a gross distortion of reality
JonathanHaidt_2012S-0053174-0054146 put out in the two oceans and it's pulling the whole country apart pulling left and right into their own territories like the bloods and the crips
JonathanHaidt_2012S-0063911-0065753 from my experience and from what i've heard from congressional insiders most of the people going to congress are good hard working intelligent people who really want to solve problems but once they get there they find that they are forced to play a game that rewards hyper partisanship and that punishes independent thinking you step out of line you get punished
JonathanHaidt_2012S-0086633-0088536 within a decade or two most american children will be born into homes with no father this means that there's much less money coming into the house but it's not just money it's also stability versus chaos as i know from working with street children in brazil mom's boyfriend is often a really really dangerous person for kids
JonathanHaidt_2012S-0101519-0103261 so to conclude there are at least four asteroids headed our way how many of you can see all four please raise your hand right now if you're willing to admit that all four of these are national problems please raise your hands okay almost all of you
JonathanHaidt_2012S-0114814-0115877 groups of fiscal conservatives and christian conservatives have come together to form a group called right on crime and at times they have worked with the southern poverty law center
JonathanHarris_2007-0008775-0009921 it's nothing new but the thing about self expression is that there's traditionally been this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friends who are willing to stand around and listen
JonathanHarris_2007-0017240-0017759 then knowing the geographical location and the time we can also then figure out the weather when that person wrote the sentence
JonathanHarris_2007-0027310-0028197 murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling and then one by one in reverse chronological order they excuse themselves entering the scrolling list of feelings
JonathanHarris_2007-0034411-0034513 i think i feel a little
JonathanHarris_2007-0046183-0047045 but i'll spare you that so here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected i feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me
JonathanHarris_2007-0062262-0063070 the first night i looked at all this information and really started seeing the gaps that i talked about earlier the differences in age gender and wealth and so on
JonathanHarris_2007-0077495-0078459 you can start to see words emerging here and those are the constellations those are the constellations of today and i can turn them all on and you can see them moving across the sky now
JonathanHarris_2007-0090649-0091416 if we open this up we get different perspectives on this story you can click any of those to go out and read the article at the source this one's
JonathanHarris_2007P-0001622-0002580 so i'm going to talk today about collecting stories in some unconventional ways this is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life
JonathanHarris_2007P-0015621-0016845 one such project is about a year and a half old it's called we feel fine this is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes searching for occurrences of the phrases i feel and i am feeling
JonathanHarris_2007P-0027214-0028437 causes the feelings to assume the physical traits of the weather they represent so the sunny ones swirl around the cloudy ones float along the rainy ones fall down and the snowy ones flutter to the ground you can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside
JonathanHarris_2007P-0046575-0047548 we're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position some kind of omniscient external body through whose eyes you see the story we're very used to this
JonathanHarris_2007P-0063823-0064625 they use no chainsaws or anything it's entirely just blades and an incredibly efficient process this is the guys on the rope pulling open the carcass
JonathanHarris_2007P-0079927-0080803 fifty three year old farmer she was chaffing wheat and that pile of wheat behind her had taken her about a week to make she wanted to keep farming until she dies
JonathanHarris_2007P-0097485-0098289 this orange sugary candy that he kept dipping his fingers into and since there was so much saliva on his hands this orange paste started to form on his palms
JonathanHarris_2007P-0112045-0112520 do you hope would you prefer to live in the cave for forty years or to live for one year
JonathanKlein_2010U-0004466-0005608 best described as iconic so iconic perhaps they're cliches in fact they're so well known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different
JonathanKlein_2010U-0011010-0012019 this destructive power takes many different forms for example these images taken by brent stirton in the congo these gorillas were murdered some would even say crucified
JonathanKlein_2010U-0019748-0020673 a student killed by the national guard at kent state university in ohio during a protest in fact these images became the voices of protest themselves
JonathanTrent_2012G-0002630-0004133 fertilizer or land so here's what i came up with imagine that we build an enclosure where we put it just underwater and we fill it with wastewater and some form of microalgae that produces oil and we make it out of some kind of flexible material that moves with waves underwater
JonathanTrent_2012G-0016720-0018643 different cities around the world treat their waste water differently some cities process it some cities just release the water but in all cases the water that's released is perfectly adequate for growing microalgae so let's envision what the system might look like we call it omega which is an acronym for offshore membrane enclosures for growing algae
JonathanTrent_2012G-0031520-0033379 and that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanks to test some of these ideas we also set up experiments in san francisco at one of the three waste water treatment plants again a facility to test ideas and finally we wanted to see where we could look at what the impact of this structure would be
JonathanTrent_2012G-0049656-0050741 well we found of course that this material became overgrown with algae and we needed then to develop a cleaning procedure and we also looked at how seabirds and marine mammals interacted
JonathanTrent_2012G-0064553-0064770 so
JonathanTrent_2012G-0081431-0082223 i think we need to consider everything everything from alpha to omega thank you
JonathanZittrain_2009G-0012215-0013356 no particular amount of capital to invest of the sort that for a physical network you might need for trucks and people and a hub to move packages around overnight they had none of that
JonathanZittrain_2009G-0019224-0019856 that's why the mascot of internet engineering if it had one is said to be the
JonathanZittrain_2009G-0026207-0026982 to get it to the destination no one pays you to do this it's just part of your neighborly duty and
JonathanZittrain_2009G-0042576-0043437 then at moment number two you have the fake announcement go out and within two minutes it reverberates around
JonathanZittrain_2009G-0058576-0059408 the wiki was introduced so others could make suggestions on edits as almost an afterthought a back room and then it turns out the back room grew
JonathanZittrain_2009G-0072961-0073547 so what we see what we see
JonathanZittrain_2009G-0088996-0089037 but then
JonathanZittrain_2009G-0099484-0100835 so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it and it's no longer just a i don't know i couldn't get there i guess i'll move on but suddenly a collective consciousness about what is blocked and censored where online
JonathanZittrain_2009G-0117233-0118104 what it's saying to you is what we heard yesterday demosthenes was saying to us it's saying let's march thank you very much
JoseAntonioAbreu_2009-0025365-0025395 last
JoseAntonioAbreu_2009-0033718-0033747 and
JoseAntonioAbreu_2009-0045333-0045353 is
JoseAntonioAbreu_2009-0075083-0075326 is that the
JoseAntonioAbreu_2009-0098212-0098952 for fifty gifted young musicians passionate about their art and social justice
JosephKim_2013G-0031277-0032477 i made it to china on february fifteen two thousand and six i was sixteen years old i thought things in china would be easier since there was more food
JosephKim_2013G-0060146-0060851 this is my message to you have hope for yourself but also help each other
JosephLekuton_2007G-0023931-0024303 and that's my goal and right now i have in place for the last nine months
JosephNye_2010G-0004201-0004472 the other is power diffusion
JosephNye_2010G-0011893-0012150 and more than half of the world's product
JosephNye_2010G-0024815-0025645 but think of what it does to how we think in traditional terms and concepts we think in terms of war and interstate war
JosephNye_2010G-0036236-0037064 but we need a new narrative if we're to understand power in the twenty one st century it's not just prevailing at war though war still persists
JosephNye_2010G-0050369-0050669 in terms of china and the united states
JosephNye_2010G-0065107-0065782 so these simple projections of the goldman sachs type are not telling us what we need to know about power transition
JosephNye_2010G-0079184-0080033 let me say a word now about the distribution of power and how it relates to power diffusion and then pull these two types together
JosephNye_2010G-0091335-0092558 that's good for us as well as good for china as well as good for everybody else so empowering china to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody
JosephNye_2010G-0105093-0106023 as she put it using all the tools in our foreign policy tool box and if we're going to deal with these two great power shifts that i've
JosephPine_2004-0011226-0011939 what that means is that it's time to move to a new level of economic value time to go beyond the goods and the services
JosephPine_2004-0016122-0016337 think about meaningful places
JosephPine_2004-0021282-0021404 we like real
JosephPine_2004-0034890-0035139 with the service economy it is about
JosephPine_2004-0041280-0041612 at which authenticity entered the lexicon if you will
JosephPine_2004-0046788-0047129 you think about that you do in fact get a two by two
JosephPine_2004-0056282-0057621 right because you can see behind the facade right it is what it says it is it's universal studio it's in the city of los angeles you're going to walk a lot right you don't tend to walk a lot in los angeles well here's a place where you are going to walk a lot outside in this city
JosephPine_2004-0063414-0063602 and thereby repudiate that heritage
JosephPine_2004-0073851-0074023 for people to experience who you are
JosephPine_2004-0080670-0081745 so authenticity is becoming the new consumer sensibility let me summarize it for the business people in the audience with three rules three basic rules
JosetteSheeran_2011G-0005532-0005727 about a billion people on earth
JosetteSheeran_2011G-0012910-0013346 think about malthusian nightmares will we be able to feed
JosetteSheeran_2011G-0023617-0024102 this is last week in northern kenya yet again
JosetteSheeran_2011G-0033048-0033671 and who was deeply malnourished and we can see brain volumes up to forty percent less
JosetteSheeran_2011G-0041676-0042030 less than seven percent of the children are breastfed
JosetteSheeran_2011G-0049878-0051600 in the food industry to be available for traditional crops and this is made with chickpeas dried milk and a host of vitamins matched to exactly what the brain needs it costs seventeen cents for us to produce this as what i call food for humanity
JosetteSheeran_2011G-0063217-0063977 and we find that if we keep girls in school later they'll stay in school until they're sixteen and won't get married if there's food in school
JosetteSheeran_2011G-0073626-0074038 the face not of small areas of big areas of the world
JosetteSheeran_2011G-0081075-0081262 the food economy moving
JosetteSheeran_2011G-0085097-0085299 from the women in africa
JosetteSheeran_2011G-0095429-0096747 many millions of people out of hunger and poverty it is transforming the face of hunger in brazil and it's at scale and it's creating opportunities i've gone out there i've met with the small farmers
JosetteSheeran_2011G-0107846-0108380 i believe we're living at a time in human history where it's just simply unacceptable
JoshSilver_2009G-0005989-0007200 the world health organization estimates well they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses the lowest estimate is one hundred and fifty million people
JoshSilver_2009G-0017044-0018276 a pair of glasses i shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses i shall put this in my pocket i'm short sighted i look at the signs at the end i can hardly see them
JoshuaFoer_2012-0001627-0001939 like to invite you to close your eyes
JoshuaFoer_2012-0012663-0013271 are coming towards you dorothy the tin man the scarecrow and the lion from the wizard of oz
JoshuaFoer_2012-0022527-0024069 feats of memory using a set of ancient techniques techniques invented two thousand five hundred years ago in greece the same techniques that cicero had used to memorize his speeches that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books
JoshuaFoer_2012-0033324-0033875 i met this guy this is kim peek he was the basis for dustin hoffman's character in the movie rain man
JoshuaFoer_2012-0040307-0041387 that have made it progressively easier and easier for us to externalize our memories for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity
JoshuaFoer_2012-0051926-0053566 where every year somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly and then the rest of the field has to play catchup this is my friend ben pridmore three time world memory champion on his desk in front of him are thirty six shuffled packs of playing cards
JoshuaFoer_2012-0063614-0065016 bakers have flour on their hands bakers smell good when they come home from work maybe we even know a baker and when we first hear that word we start putting these associational hooks into it that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date
JoshuaFoer_2012-0072727-0073542 nobody can say where they were sitting the bodies can't be properly buried it's one tragedy compounding another
JoshuaFoer_2012-0082948-0083252 let's say that you've been invited
JoshuaFoer_2012-0092575-0093203 i thought this was just fascinating and i got really into it and i went to a few more of these memory contests
JoshuaFoer_2012-0105031-0105342 i won the contest
JoshuaFoer_2012-0110186-0111859 at the most basic level we remember when we pay attention we remember when we are deeply engaged we remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience and figure out why it is meaningful to us why it is significant why it's colorful when we're able
JoshuaFoer_2012-0116796-0117033 the notion that our lives
JoshuaKlein_2008-0007654-0008631 started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living
JoshuaKlein_2008-0023526-0024260 so it turns out we've been finding more and more that crows are really really intelligent their brains are proportionate in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are
JoshuaKlein_2008-0040635-0041379 the point being that they've developed cultural adaptation and as we heard yesterday that's the pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble and we're starting to see it with
JoshuaKlein_2008-0054205-0055045 down picks it up drops it in the slot and then we're off to the races that crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts until his friends figure out how to do it and then
JoshuaPrager_2013-0006728-0007030 i was then nineteen years old
JoshuaPrager_2013-0015149-0015418 and when i saw this photograph
JoshuaPrager_2013-0020699-0021051 be careful abed look out slow down
JoshuaPrager_2013-0025117-0025390 and when abed went on about how hurt he was in the crash
JoshuaPrager_2013-0028433-0028636 i pitched overhand
JoshuaPrager_2013-0037528-0037682 abed would hug me
JoshuaPrager_2013-0043624-0043833 i'd been driving for an hour
JoshuaPrager_2013-0051485-0052077 and i was mentioning abed and myself noting deliberately that i was here in peace to the people in this town
JoshuaPrager_2013-0058159-0058526 and she told me that her husband abed would be home from work in four hours
JoshuaPrager_2013-0066397-0066592 i was handsome he said
JoshuaPrager_2013-0076053-0076371 but now he said he was religious and god was pleased
JoshuaPrager_2013-0081948-0082139 lost his truck license for a decade
JoshuaPrager_2013-0085430-0085776 the goat becomes the hero the perpetrator becomes the victim
JoshuaPrager_2013-0087793-0087965 he was a limited man
JoshuaPrager_2013-0098823-0099022 i wished to tell him that in the end
JoshuaPrager_2013-0103794-0104256 that is the one singular gift you may receive if you suffer in any existential way
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006-0002920-0004116 transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call sort of a rational conclusion to something and it concludes in something that you see here that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006-0022482-0023348 in this case what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book and so we proposed what's at the lower diagram very dumb approach
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006-0039041-0040021 and so this was the final operation which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter and to hold onto them with a skin that skin serves double duty again for economics
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006-0053063-0053530 very quickly get into the book spiral because i think it's as i said the most this is the main reading room
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006-0070560-0071263 i'm going to show you what what this actually means this is the theater up close any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006-0084176-0084881 operate within the one hundred year floodplain now this area floods three to four times a year and there's a levee behind our site similar to the ones that
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2006-0096316-0097207 everything that the different commercial elements would have and combined it in the center in the sort of subway map in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X-0006889-0007540 the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex and has gotten much more litigious and we architects are cowards
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X-0014546-0015154 now i'd argue that that is absurd as stating that thirty minutes of copulation is the creative act
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X-0028800-0029431 now this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor because of course we all know that inside of the trojan horse were a bunch of people with spears
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X-0047105-0048327 was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house and redefine them as above house and below house at first blush you think hey it's crazy what could you possibly gain we created what we like to call superfly
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X-0060578-0061266 because they say the first thing they have to do the first five minutes of any show is they have to get our architecture out of the mind of their patron
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X-0071324-0072156 a thrust into the space and some of the seats need to actually change their direction and change their rake to allow that to happen i'll do it again so you can see it
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X-0076049-0076692 if you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena and be able to do the ice capades the next night that would also be
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X-0083212-0084359 as i said all that was in service of creating a flexible yet affordable configuration but we got this other benefit and that was the ability of the perimeter to suddenly engage dallas on the outside
JoshuaPrinceRamus_2009X-0094997-0095841 so the theater company has the ability to do totally hermetic light controlled sound controlled great acoustics great intimacy shakespeare
JoshuaWalters_2011S-0009643-0010109 there's no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time
JoshuaWalters_2011S-0028611-0029032 your call your call and everyone's somewhere in the middle
JuanEnriquez_2003-0008263-0008446 it's beginning to tell us a lot about evolution
JuanEnriquez_2003-0021303-0022554 we're finding amoebas like this this is amoeba dubia and amoeba dubia doesn't look like much except that each of you has about three point two billion letters which is what makes you you as far as gene code inside each
JuanEnriquez_2003-0040771-0042015 it's just beginning to understand this code of dna that's really the most exciting intellectual adventure that we've ever been on and you can do strange things with this stuff this is a baby gar
JuanEnriquez_2003-0059745-0060397 make a stem next line of code tacgggg make a flower that's white that blooms in the spring that smells like this
JuanEnriquez_2003-0077979-0078341 so men read that sentence and they look at that sentence and they read
JuanEnriquez_2003-0094229-0095212 contains less data than is coming out of a good genomics company every month on a compound basis let me say that again a single genomics company generates more data
JuanEnriquez_2003-0107713-0108468 and that's it and that's the triangle between salk scripps ucsd and it's called torrey pines road
JuanEnriquez_2003-0122756-0123703 and they are now about four point eight percent two billion people one third of the global population producing five percent of the wealth because they didn't get this change because
JuanEnriquez_2007S-0005385-0005622 and to do that you really have to look first at agriculture
JuanEnriquez_2007S-0015357-0016438 and you move from a discipline of engineering you move from a discipline of chemistry into a discipline of biology and probably one of the most important human beings on the planet is this guy behind me
JuanEnriquez_2007S-0026731-0026807 look different
JuanEnriquez_2007S-0032427-0032664 mountains of stuff that people have overproduced
JuanEnriquez_2007S-0035489-0035614 we don't know where oil comes from
JuanEnriquez_2007S-0039094-0039979 if you think of bioenergy bioenergy isn't ethanol bioenergy is taking the sun concentrating it in amoebas concentrating it in plants
JuanEnriquez_2007S-0043701-0043849 this is how you farm oil
JuanEnriquez_2007S-0050859-0051025 not entirely unlike coal
JuanEnriquez_2007S-0056359-0057430 as you think of what are the alternatives to this system it's important to find alternatives because it turns out that the u s is dwindling in its petroleum reserves but it is not dwindling in its coal reserves
JuanEnriquez_2007S-0064624-0065546 it may turn out that biological processes in coal mines have the same process if that is true then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to
JuanEnriquez_2007S-0075378-0076496 and in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is interchangeable that can become energy that can become food that can become fiber that can become human beings that can become a whole series of things
JuanEnriquez_2007S-0086122-0086686 it is very expensive to process this stuff both in economic terms and in energy terms
JuanEnriquez_2007S-0093308-0093449 the name of the game is hydrocarbons
JuanEnriquez_2007S-0099933-0100170 that is a stupid way of managing this system
JuanEnriquez_2007S-0107473-0108398 not put people through this cycle where it doesn't pay to research because your company will go out of business as opec drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from happening
JuanEnriquez_2009-0011344-0011908 and that of course is the reason why all of you are making such generous and wonderful donations to these nice folks
JuanEnriquez_2009-0024323-0024446 and then all bets are off
JuanEnriquez_2009-0033052-0033288 if you're under fifty we want you to work four more years
JuanEnriquez_2009-0048276-0049504 in parallel the folks at mit have been building a standard registry of biological parts so think of it as a radio shack for biology you can go out and get your proteins your rna your dna whatever and start building stuff
JuanEnriquez_2009-0057323-0058385 four years ago i showed you this picture and people oohed and ahhed because cliff tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken and that was very cool stuff back
JuanEnriquez_2009-0065941-0067309 so a spanish woman who was dying of tb had a donor trachea they took all the cells off the trachea they spraypainted her stem cells on to that cartilage she regrew her own trachea and seventy two hours later it was
JuanEnriquez_2009-0069603-0069913 this is kind of getting boring right i mean you understand where this story's going
JuanEnriquez_2009-0073616-0074012 and this is becoming common it's moving very quickly it's moving in a whole series of places
JuanEnriquez_2009-0085430-0085792 he sued to be allowed to run and he won the
JuanEnriquez_2009-0096516-0096643 to keep an eye on the future
JuanEnriquez_2009-0107151-0107365 that would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint
JuanEnriquez_2012S-0004910-0005415 prongs in the center of this picture if you take a close up of those they look like this
JuanEnriquez_2012S-0016503-0016918 so within that context there's two theories of the case as to why we're all here
JuanEnriquez_2012S-0026762-0027114 and as you're thinking about this you might also ask the question
JuanEnriquez_2012S-0034650-0034919 so very small changes can have a big impact
JuanEnriquez_2012S-0043855-0044556 well it turns out that every male olympic power athelete ever tested carries at least one of these variants
JuanEnriquez_2012S-0054514-0054995 and we may just be in some of these weeks
JuanEnriquez_2012S-0065163-0065421 and turn them into human stem cells
JuanEnriquez_2012S-0074217-0074481 and this might have just one or two small
JuanEnriquez_2012S-0089575-0090459 but what's beginning to happen is because these geeks are all getting together because they are highly qualified for computer programming and it is highly remunerated
JuanEnriquez_2013U-0005742-0006130 if i can ask an indiscreet question how many of you have tattoos
JuanEnriquez_2013U-0022267-0022441 it's a little like your reputation
JuanEnriquez_2013U-0032993-0033455 he came back and said oh come on how else can you threaten other than with death
JudyJohnston_2013U-0009953-0011755 what we found is that with a plan and the right people quality of life can remain high the beginning of the end is triggered by a mortality awareness event and during this time jim and shirley chose acr nature preserves to take their ranch over when they were
JudyJohnston_2013U-0024475-0024832 your admission is streamlined in a material way
JuliaBacha_2011G-0007545-0008856 this divide between what's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we don't have yet a palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful
JuliaBacha_2011G-0034716-0035708 violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common they are both
JuliaBacha_2011G-0049354-0050497 so we organized a screening a week later they held the most well attended and disciplined demonstration to date
JuliaSweeney_2006-0013057-0014218 so i said well mom and dad what about santa claus i mean santa claus knows if you're naughty or nice right and my dad said yeah but honey i think that's technically just between thanksgiving and christmas
JuliaSweeney_2006-0029032-0030118 i didn't know it at the time but i really wasn't turning seven on september ten for my thirteenth birthday i planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and
JuliaSweeney_2006-0044663-0045654 two mormon missionaries came to my door now i just live off a main thoroughfare in los angeles and my block is well it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door
JuliaSweeney_2006-0057541-0058245 yes yes i do i feel very loved and they looked at each other and smiled like that was the right answer
JuliaSweeney_2006-0075405-0076255 said do you believe that god speaks to us through his righteous prophets and i said no i don't because i was sort of upset about this lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story
JuliaSweeney_2006-0086747-0087824 i said oh now i don't have a uterus because i had cancer a few years ago so does this mean that if i went to heaven i would get my old uterus back and they said sure
JuliaSweeney_2010-0003061-0003422 lay eggs and the eggs turn into tadpoles and tadpoles turn into frogs
JuliaSweeney_2010-0011205-0011722 coming out and you go through the woman's vagina and so we're just eating and her jaw just drops and
JuliaSweeney_2010-0025359-0025378 we
JulianAssange_2010G-0007834-0008183 or not vet it like a regular news organization
JulianAssange_2010G-0018250-0018514 it's the holy grail of kenyan journalism
JulianAssange_2010G-0032905-0033210 so what was the impact of that
JulianAssange_2010G-0036932-0037495 can see the gross disparity in force you have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street and
JulianAssange_2010G-0042872-0043517 the reykjavik u s embassy but this is not necessarily connected i mean i was a known visitor
JulianAssange_2010G-0050465-0051469 are there risks with that either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence
JulianAssange_2010G-0061316-0061729 not really i mean we don't have any wikileaks dissidents yet
JulianAssange_2010G-0073351-0074121 that basis we put it out and said look we're skeptical about this thing we don't know but what can we do the material looks good it feels right but we
JulianAssange_2010G-0084677-0085709 yeah and trusted people i mean we're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with so we have to restructure in order to
JulianAssange_2010G-0094085-0094964 what about your core values can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped
JulianAssange_2010G-0103816-0104519 july last year and the national tv station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air like out of a movie
JulianTreasure_2009G-0003886-0004522 you all the time and i'd like to raise them in your consciousness today first is physiological
JulianTreasure_2009G-0023728-0023872 the younger maybe not
JulianTreasure_2010G-0005515-0005899 the loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that
JulianTreasure_2010G-0014453-0015291 it's a really big problem now when you were little if you had noise and you didn't want to hear it you'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum these days you can do a similar thing it just looks a bit cooler
JulianTreasure_2010G-0030550-0032312 have a foreground a background all in beautiful proportion it's fun to get into designing with sound if you can't do it yourself get a professional to do it for you sound design is the future and i think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds i'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities eight ways sound can improve health
JulianTreasure_2010GU-0006353-0007809 listening is an active skill whereas hearing is passive listening is something that we have to work at it's a relationship with sound and yet it's a skill that none of us are taught for example have you ever considered that there are listening positions places you can listen from here are two of them
JulianTreasure_2010GU-0015437-0016679 this the trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues the first really big health issue is a word that murray schafer coined schizophonia it's a dislocation
JulianTreasure_2010GU-0027342-0027723 you to seek out wwb wind water
JulianTreasure_2010GU-0041188-0042532 my vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things we will take a very big step in that direction so i urge you to take that path i'm leaving you with a little more birdsong which is very good for you i wish you sound health
JulianTreasure_2011G-0009673-0010118 now that's something i fall short of on a daily basis
JulianTreasure_2011G-0021468-0022012 this is a serious problem that we're losing our listening this is not trivial
JulianTreasure_2011G-0041738-0042583 that's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill why is it not taught it's crazy
JulianTreasure_2012G-0023371-0025332 children are losing one word in two now that doesn't mean they only get half their education but it does mean they have to work very hard to join the dots and understand what's going on this is affected massively by reverberation time how reverberant a room is in a classroom with a reverberation time of one point two seconds which is pretty common
JulianTreasure_2012G-0043792-0044008 ninety thousand pounds a year
JulianTreasure_2012G-0053625-0054463 finally we have homes we use interior designers where are the interior sound designers hey let's all be interior sound designers

JulianaRotich_2013G-0004185-0006177 these revolutions have not been evenly distributed across continents and nations never have been now this is a map of the undersea fiber optic cables that connect africa to the rest of the world what i find amazing is that africa is transcending its geography problem
JulianaRotich_2013G-0021585-0023118 there is more that we're doing to explore this idea of collective intelligence that i as a citizen if i share the information with whatever device that i have could inform you about what is going on and that if you do the same we can have a bigger picture of what's going on
JulianaRotich_2013G-0043289-0044318 you pick on the fastest network so we'll have multi sim capability so that you can put multiple sims and if one network is faster that's the one you hop on
JulieBurstein_2012-0002233-0002603 that began in japan centuries ago as a way

JulieBurstein_2012-0049038-0049384 who would be standing where you might stand to look at the picture
JulieBurstein_2012-0059346-0059624 that led him to the work that he's known for today
JulieBurstein_2012-0063387-0064001 in order to create we have to stand in that space between what we see in the world and what we hope for
JulieBurstein_2012-0069372-0069782 with a straight view downtown to the world trade center
JulieBurstein_2012-0079198-0079431 for nine months almost every day
JulieBurstein_2012-0090773-0091017 you have to take a picture
JulieBurstein_2012-0101394-0101705 of the cycle of creation and destruction
JulieTaymor_2011-0020756-0020961 all of a sudden stood up
JulieTaymor_2011-0028972-0029168 they needed the light to see
JulieTaymor_2011-0037490-0038238 the circle that when we come to act ii and there's a drought how do you express drought it's a circle of silk
JulieTaymor_2011-0046167-0046370 the mechanics the methods
JulieTaymor_2011-0048792-0049191 some clips from the other big project of my life this year
JulieTaymor_2011-0064987-0065290 idea or story and moves it into cinema
JulieTaymor_2011-0070429-0070775 and as she was there on the edge of that stage
JulieTaymor_2011-0077721-0078398 of a sand castle a black sand castle and what cinema can do is by using camera
JulieTaymor_2011-0104053-0104335 and i got down on all fours like a cat
JustinHallTipping_2011G-0009629-0009840 through the lens of normal
JustinHallTipping_2011G-0018059-0018234 and we formed a company
JustinHallTipping_2011G-0026375-0026562 chickenwire rolled up
JustinHallTipping_2011G-0034015-0034631 until you change its state again as we were working on this incredible discovery at university of florida
JustinHallTipping_2011G-0038425-0038641 than the width of a decimal place
JustinHallTipping_2011G-0042049-0042250 it's a film that you can look through
JustinHallTipping_2011G-0048401-0048744 we want to talk about storing energy and unfortunately
JustinHallTipping_2011G-0056079-0057007 the grid of tomorrow is no grid and energy clean efficient energy
JustinHallTipping_2011G-0067053-0067384 i've carried this photograph with me every day since then
KRamdas_2009I-0006054-0007037 in the midst of the daunting challenges we face as a global community there's something about this third way raga that is making my heart sing
KRamdas_2009I-0019185-0019938 us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all poor things you only have three daughters
KRamdas_2009I-0028613-0029489 by eighteen under the excellent tutelage of my mother i was therefore as you might expect defiantly feminist on the streets
KRamdas_2009I-0043352-0044631 she smiled slyly he was flattered he began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque and after he would leave women and girls would stay behind
KRamdas_2009I-0060074-0060930 a bosnian love song and serbian duets and leah adds with a grin kavita we are especially proud of our christmas music
KRamdas_2009I-0073116-0073759 among layma's friends was a policewoman who was muslim she promised to raise the issue with her community
KRamdas_2009I-0086308-0087327 and the women of liberia then mobilized in support of ellen johnson sirleaf a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman head of state in africa in
KRamdas_2009I-0098067-0098776 the colonizers it's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions that we women far too often
KakenyaNtaiya_2012X-0008950-0009857 i did everything that i needed to do to become a perfect wife
KakenyaNtaiya_2012X-0028795-0030347 and as we danced and danced and we approached this circle of women men women children everybody was there there was a woman sitting in the middle of it and this woman was waiting to hold us i was
KakenyaNtaiya_2012X-0047235-0047726 but i needed the support of the village and here again
KakenyaNtaiya_2012X-0067434-0068357 as we moved and i went to talk to the fathers the fathers of course you can imagine what they said we want a school for boys and i said
KakiKing_2008-0001585-0002205 i was thinking about my place in the universe and about my first thought about what
KakiKing_2008-0053672-0054582 those of you who i'll be fortunate enough to meet afterwards you could please refrain from saying oh my god you're so much shorter in real life
KamalMeattle_2009U-0008782-0009895 which is again a common plant and we call it a bedroom plant because it converts co two into oyxgen at night and we need six to eight waist high plants per person
KarenArmstrong_2008-0001319-0001445 well this is such
KarenArmstrong_2008-0011476-0012458 sister religions of christianity and while i found i knew nothing about these faiths at all despite my own intensely religious background
KarenArmstrong_2008-0023449-0024088 indeed some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy in the
KarenArmstrong_2008-0036051-0036914 first propounded by confucius five centuries before christ do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you that he said was the central
KarenArmstrong_2008-0048714-0049410 where terrorists cite qur'anic verses to justify their atrocities
KarenArmstrong_2008-0060021-0060503 make no mistake about it religion is a kind of fault line
KarenArmstrong_2008-0073051-0073870 where literally thousands of people came to my lectures because they were yearning first of all to hear a friendly western voice
KarenArmstrong_2008-0083252-0084217 we should not treat other nations as we would not wish to be treated ourselves and these whatever our wretched beliefs
KarenArmstrong_2008-0093465-0093638 he kills
KarenArmstrong_2008-0100675-0101663 that is the ethos found too in all the religions it's what is meant by overcoming the horror that we feel when we
KarenArmstrong_2008-0110423-0111109 to give guidelines as to how to interpret the scriptures these texts that are being abused
KarenArmstrong_2008-0124841-0125239 to building this charter launching it and propagating it
KarenArmstrong_2009G-0009947-0010080 world put another
KarenArmstrong_2009G-0022337-0023563 and of course it's not just religious people who believe in the golden rule this is the source of all morality this imaginative act of empathy putting yourself in the
KarenArmstrong_2009G-0028766-0029944 we need to revive that spirit and it's not just going to happen because a spirit of love wafts us down we have to make this happen and we can do it
KarenArmstrong_2009G-0034555-0035529 the muslim communities are holding events and discussions are discussing the centrality of compassion in islam and in all faiths
KarenArmstrong_2009G-0047823-0048823 thought of putting the charter online i was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room and issuing yet another arcane statement
KarenArmstrong_2009G-0055952-0057270 i am convinced i felt it very strongly during our little deliberations at vevey that when people of all different persuasions come together
KarenBass_2012-0009658-0009823 we wanted to do just that
KarenBass_2012-0024148-0026014 and that sequence was especially difficult the first year we got nothing we had to go back the following year all the way back to the remote parts of alaska and we hung around with a helicopter for two whole weeks and eventually we got lucky
KarenBass_2012-0040897-0041380 now people often ask me where's your favorite place on the planet
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G-0004495-0005195 in their small boats they carried only rudimentary navigational equipment and limited supplies of food and water
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G-0018820-0019221 and marcel proust so the question is what can the rest of us learn
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G-0037336-0038696 as a writer i can tell you that a big part of writing fiction is learning to predict how one event in a story will affect all the other events and fear works in that same way in fear just like in fiction one thing always leads to another
KarenThompsonWalker_2012G-0049152-0050426 after much deliberation the men finally made a decision terrified of cannibals they decided to forgo the closest islands and instead embarked on the longer and much more difficult route to south
KarenTse_2011G-0002276-0002621 who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel
KarenTse_2011G-0016732-0018575 and even twenty years later there was only ten lawyers in the country so consequently you'd walk into a prison and not only would you meet twelve year old boys you'd meet women and you'd say why are you here women would say well i've been here for ten years because my husband committed a crime but they can't find him so it's just a place where there was no rule of law
KarenTse_2011G-0045951-0047028 implement early access to counsel because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured and as i tell you this i'm also aware of the fact that
KartickSatyanarayan_2009I-0007831-0008412 and the economy of the family and their livelihood depended on those animals so we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner
KaryMullis_2002-0004593-0004801 the world people think they're sort of lowbrows
KaryMullis_2002-0014654-0015625 that conversations that got going in like bars and stuff would turn to this is kind of it's hard to believe but people in the seventeenth century in england
KaryMullis_2002-0021782-0022398 and people in the seventeenth century they didn't really understand the same way we do
KaryMullis_2002-0027888-0029170 kills the bird and i'm calling it a vacuum and the religious people said that if god wanted you to make i mean god is everywhere that was one of their rules is god is everywhere
KaryMullis_2002-0043612-0045007 so they were the really important part of this was you were not supposed to talk about final causes for instance and god was out of the picture the actual nature of reality was not at issue
KaryMullis_2002-0056690-0057537 and and and mathematics which is really not science but experimental science has been tied up with all those things and
KaryMullis_2002-0072278-0072877 was got into trouble the other night at dinner because of the post modernism thing and i didn't mean you know where is that lady
KaryMullis_2002-0080003-0080084 i i i
KaryMullis_2002-0091488-0092349 just to see what would happen if you mixed it together and it they burned it burned kind of slow but it made a nice smell compared to other rocket fuels i had tried that all had sulfur in
KaryMullis_2002-0102357-0102790 by the way i could have thought i'd better not do this
KaryMullis_2002-0116095-0117252 and i'm basically honest i have a fairly bad memory and dishonesty would always get me in trouble if i like so i've just sort of been naturally honest and naturally inquisitive and that sort of leads to that kind of science now
KaryMullis_2002-0122148-0122917 made all kinds of and then finally one giant bomb to end the whole thing right and everybody stepped back a little and said you know we ought to invest in
KaryMullis_2002-0129016-0130000 they say that they're a member of the committee called say the inter governmental panel on climate change and they and they have these big meetings where they try to figure out
KaryMullis_2002-0140621-0141190 a lot of other people later on started thinking it would be bad you know but nobody actually demonstrated
KaryMullis_2002-0153330-0154568 the sun puts out a certain amount of energy we know how much that is it falls on the earth the earth gives back a certain amount when it gets warm it generates it makes redder energy i mean like infra red like something that's warm gives
KaryMullis_2002-0173409-0174203 that if you're interested in them then you have to get down the details and read the papers called large decadal variability in the you have to figure out what all those words mean
KaryMullis_2009-0012246-0013085 really doesn't make these things at all and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street and for certain bacteria we don't
KaryMullis_2009-0024911-0025432 out what went wrong why did they not die and they didn't die because they didn't have
KateHartman_2011-0038577-0040287 and this one's particularly interesting because of all the glaciers in north america it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year they actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier and this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter
KateOrff_2010W-0007729-0008600 and reengage the lines on this graph in a more productive way and you can see from the arrow here indicating you are here
KateOrff_2010W-0013719-0015065 so albeit a very small creature and very modest this creature is incredible because it can agglomerate into these mega reef structures it can grow you can grow it and did i mention it's quite tasty
KateOrff_2010W-0020766-0021624 another set of views of actually the gowanus canal itself now the gowanus is particularly smelly i will admit it there are problems of sewage overflow
KateOrff_2010W-0035795-0036426 so we were inspired by the oyster but i was also inspired by they life cycle of the oyster it can move from a fertilized
KateOrff_2010W-0047768-0048761 in the end what we realized we were making was a new blue green watery park for the next watery century an amphibious park if you will so get your tevas on
KateStone_2013-0001991-0003800 and that's what i say when people ask me what i do but it really confuses most people so really the best way for me to convey it is to take the technology and be creative and create experiences so i tried to think what i could use for here and a couple of weeks ago i had a crazy idea that i wanted to print
KateStone_2013-0016238-0016920 obviously one of the most important things was the sheep and so my job was well pretty much to do everything but it was about
KateStone_2013-0031792-0032385 when i spoke to some printers when i started doing this and told them what i wanted to do which was to print conductive inks onto paper
KateStone_2013-0049207-0050927 i wanted to create a poster that was wirelessly connected and had color changing inks on it and so if your energy usage was trending better than the leaves would appear and the rabbits would appear and all would be good and if it wasn't then there'd be graffiti and the leaves would fall off the trees so it was trying to make you
KatherineFulton_2007-0003993-0004237 and hope and history rhyme
KatherineFulton_2007-0013674-0013947 the gates and the soros and the google
KatherineFulton_2007-0023915-0024396 this is of course to philanthropy what ebay and amazon are to commerce
KatherineFulton_2007-0032705-0032900 venture capital private equity
KatherineFulton_2007-0041227-0041593 and the organization is at the center as opposed to putting the problem at the center
KatherineFulton_2007-0049158-0049908 and even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers don't yet fulfill this aspiration i think this is the
KatherineFulton_2007-0056116-0056342 and i think it's gong to quite significant
KatherineFulton_2007-0067122-0067367 i keep this photograph close by to me
KathrynSchulz_2011-0002095-0002635 and a friend and i go on a road trip from providence rhode island to portland oregon
KathrynSchulz_2011-0006157-0006629 my friend looks at me totally blankly
KathrynSchulz_2011-0011755-0012724 and how we behave when that happens and what all of this can tell us about human nature in other words as you heard chris say
KathrynSchulz_2011-0020791-0021156 and i think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture
KathrynSchulz_2011-0031269-0032965 but the thing is the coyote runs off the cliff right after him and what's funny at least if you're six years old is that the coyote's totally fine too he just keeps running right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in mid air
KathrynSchulz_2011-0043598-0043990 we learn these really bad lessons really well
KathrynSchulz_2011-0057579-0058121 and when we act like it is and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong
KathrynSchulz_2011-0067561-0068242 so this is a catastrophe this attachment to our own rightness
KathrynSchulz_2011-0075075-0075307 and also this and also this and yeah it is also why we get things wrong
KathrynSchulz_2011-0084451-0084883 and the crypto theme is i thought this one thing was going to
KathrynSchulz_2011-0090233-0091101 and hosni mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of egypt for the rest of his life until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son

KathrynSchulz_2011S-0008781-0009685 and by regretted it i mean that i stepped outside of the tattoo place this is just a couple miles from here down on the lower east side
KathrynSchulz_2011S-0027411-0027687 so let's say for instance that
KathrynSchulz_2011S-0048210-0048713 how could i have done that what was i thinking
KathrynSchulz_2011S-0064177-0064984 now there is a case to be made that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos and i'm going to return to that point in a few minutes
KathrynSchulz_2011S-0080502-0080789 humor plays a crucial role in helping us survive
KathrynSchulz_2011S-0095445-0096519 if we have goals and dreams and we want to do our best and if we love people and we don't want to hurt them or lose them
KavitaRamdas_2009I-0007956-0009052 why is it that women are on the one hand viciously oppressed by cultural practices and yet at the same time are the preservers of cultures in most societies
KavitaRamdas_2009I-0016463-0018285 and a taboo breaker in liberia i'm indebted to them as i am to my parents who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life were blessed with three daughters in this one and for reasons equally unclear to me seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us
KavitaRamdas_2009I-0034593-0035145 she said to me it is not about the burka she was the most
KavitaRamdas_2009I-0046649-0047475 she is on the taliban's hit list i worry about her every time she travels across that country she shrugs when i ask her about safety

KavitaRamdas_2009I-0078853-0080049 the peace talks dragged on and on and on layma and her sisters had had enough with their remaining funds they took a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks and they surrounded the building
KavitaRamdas_2009I-0096534-0096978 who couldn't help his sister but has helped three daughters pursue their dreams
KeesMoeliker_2013-0002771-0003096 back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five
KeesMoeliker_2013-0010556-0010813 both are of the male sex
KeesMoeliker_2013-0022832-0023171 duck hit the glass and c is from where i watched it
KeesMoeliker_2013-0036696-0036975 so here's my one minute of fame
KeesMoeliker_2013-0049595-0050026 and the prisoners had a great time
KeesMoeliker_2013-0063248-0064137 so i'll conclude to invite you all to dead duck day that's on june five every year
KeithBarry_2004-0005213-0006172 ok now cross your hands over so your right hand goes over interlace your fingers like this then make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb that's very important yours is the other way around so swap it around
KeithBarry_2004-0033484-0033844 all right but because your brains are not trained in the art of deception
KeithBarry_2004-0048391-0048747 ok excellent open your eyes i never touched you i just touched his back
KeithBarry_2004-0056251-0056384 ok now allow it to stay there
KeithBarry_2004-0069762-0070224 on five four three two one open your eyes wide awake give them a round of applause
KeithBarry_2004-0073878-0074709 for some magicians or mentalists sometimes the spoon will bend or melt sometimes it will not sometimes the object will slide across the table sometimes it will not
KeithBarry_2004-0093234-0093580 they just they insist that because i was a magician put a nice black tablecloth on
KeithBarry_2004-0113211-0113308 ok give me both hands
KeithBellows_2002-0008570-0009491 the end product of that action is up on the board here and what the missionaries would do is they'd walk around
KeithBellows_2002-0022095-0022785 so we kept on going and this camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg and eventually three miles later we arrived at
KeithBellows_2002-0042990-0043098 when
KeithBellows_2002-0068932-0069609 as horny as suki was jasmine was having none of it and so we started thinking well
KeithChen_2012G-0008964-0010591 despite all of these similarities we see huge differences in savings behavior so all the way over on the left of this graph what you see is many oecd countries saving over a quarter of their gdp every year and some oecd countries saving over a third of their gdp per year
KeithChen_2012G-0016975-0018799 you understood exactly what i just said in english if we were speaking mandarin chinese with each other though i wouldn't have that luxury i wouldn't have been able to convey so little information what my language would have forced me to do instead of just telling you this is my uncle is to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information
KeithChen_2012G-0025476-0027447 a chinese speaker can basically say something that sounds very strange to an english speaker's ears they can say yesterday it rain now it rain tomorrow it rain in some deep sense chinese doesn't divide up the time spectrum in the same way that english forces us to constantly do in order to speak correctly
KeithChen_2012G-0039528-0041401 what you see is that these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the oecd that speak futured languages what is the average difference here five percentage points of your gdp saved per year over twenty five years that has huge long run effects on the wealth of your nation
KeithChen_2012G-0055238-0056516 what are the characteristics we can control for well i'm going to match families on country of birth and residence the demographics what sex their age their income level within their own country their educational achievement a lot about their family structure
KeithChen_2012G-0068828-0070382 my linguistics and economics colleagues at yale and i are just starting to do this work and really explore and understand the ways that these subtle nudges cause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005-0012243-0012386 i really love this idea
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005-0027966-0028716 in addition you can see from the diagram on the right the under part of the slide would be an electromagnet so this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005-0043200-0043972 that when you went deep sea diving you could catch the fish really fast and then roll it back up and you could swim easier
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005-0054342-0054377 a big
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005-0060384-0060759 while he was doing this he noticed an unexpected thing we have a video to show you
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005-0068752-0069513 as this paper is bending the resistance of the ink changes so with simple electronics you can detect how much the page is being bent
KeithSchachtandZachKaplan_2005-0080942-0081843 his company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene and
KellerRinaudo_2013-0001945-0002406 okay and actually of those hands if you don't include roomba how many of you have a robot at home
KellerRinaudo_2013-0016461-0018339 and in the same way that you scroll through content on an ipad i can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device so there are all of you through romo's eyes and finally because romo is an extension of me i can express myself through his emotions so i can go in and i can say let's make romo excited
KelliSwazey_2013P-0005478-0006217 points of social and cultural interaction are not weddings or births or even family dinners
KelliSwazey_2013P-0022396-0023537 their body is placed in a special room in the traditional residence which is called the tongkonan and the tongkonan is symbolic not only of the family's identity
KelliSwazey_2013P-0042386-0043735 so the funeral ceremony itself embodies this relational perspective on death it ritualizes the impact of death on families and communities
KelliSwazey_2013P-0060521-0061058 and his death will be greatly mourned
KelliSwazey_2013P-0074213-0074684 if we could expand our definition of death to encompass life
KellyMcGonigal_2013G-0008065-0009655 let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress this study tracked thirty thousand adults in the united states for eight years and they started by asking people how much stress have you experienced in the last year
KellyMcGonigal_2013G-0020212-0021979 now to explain how this works i want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out it's called the social stress test you come into the laboratory and you're told you have to give a five minute impromptu speech on your
KellyMcGonigal_2013G-0041281-0042898 so my goal as a health psychologist has changed i no longer want to get rid of your stress i want to make you better at stress and we just did a little intervention if you raised your hand and said you'd had a lot of stress in the last year we could have saved your life
KellyMcGonigal_2013G-0055575-0056398 your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other
KellyMcGonigal_2013G-0067606-0068178 helping out friends neighbors people in your community
KellyMcGonigal_2013G-0081297-0081753 this is kind of amazing what you're telling us it seems amazing to me that a belief
KenGoldberg_2012X-0011483-0012835 but my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted either he and i worked on it for several years but it was the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet
KenGoldberg_2012X-0017755-0017931 so what i'd like to tell you about
KenGoldberg_2012X-0029580-0030192 now one day i got a call out of the blue from a student
KenGoldberg_2012X-0040293-0041901 as it was operating my students and i were very interested in how people were interacting with each other and what they were doing with the garden so we started thinking what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment like for example what if it could go to a dinner party
KenGoldberg_2012X-0055382-0055989 that they would give a kiss to sam donaldson and she said they hadn't
KenGoldberg_2012X-0070009-0070838 this project also taught me an important lesson when in doubt when your path is blocked pivot
KenGoldberg_2012X-0089958-0090296 and here's the robot operating at ten
KenJennings_2013X-0006097-0007288 the deeply closeted kind of know it all for many years but if you go further back if you look at it it's all there i was the kind of kid who was always bugging mom and dad with whatever great fact i had just read about
KenJennings_2013X-0034281-0034854 it's not the terminator's gun sight it's a little line coming closer and closer to the
KenJennings_2013X-0057708-0058229 what does this mean if we're going to be able to start outsourcing
KenJennings_2013X-0081401-0082368 now when facts come in handy like that i love that story because it shows you the power of one fact one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time
KenJennings_2013X-0101751-0102480 thank goodness i have my diploma i'm done learning for a lifetime i don't have to learn new things anymore no every day we should be striving
KenKamler_2009P-0007868-0007942 and we should
KenKamler_2009P-0021010-0021524 this is me crossing a crevasse we cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached
KenKamler_2009P-0040179-0040414 okay this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself
KenKamler_2009P-0051135-0051888 had collapsed in the snow and was dead there were still eighteen other climbers that we weren't aware of
KenKamler_2009P-0062088-0063285 it's really cold it's twenty four thousand feet the only supplies i had at that altitude were two plastic bags with preloaded syringes of painkiller and steroids so as the climbers came by me
KenKamler_2009P-0074573-0075597 what we did was try to warm them up as best we could put oxygen on them and try to revive them which is difficult to do at twenty one thousand feet when the tent is freezing
KenKamler_2009P-0078459-0079311 just like a mummy he walked into the tent i expected him to be incoherent but in fact he walked into the tent and said to me hi ken where should i
KenKamler_2009P-0083113-0083655 some climbers had come by and looked at him and he heard them say he's dead
KenKamler_2009P-0093701-0094692 and image that beck was hooked up to a spect scan this measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain so you have the prefrontal cortex here
KenKamler_2009P-0105784-0105927 which is powering his will
KenKamler_2009P-0116340-0116915 at one of the camps where some of the climbers were lost and we had a memorial service there
KentLarson_2012X-0003889-0004200 you needed easy access to the fields
KentLarson_2012X-0020302-0021907 the home once again because of distributed computation communication is becoming a center of life so it's a center of production and learning and shopping and health care and all of these things that we used to think of as taking place outside of the home
KentLarson_2012X-0037427-0037623 without crossing the street
KentLarson_2012X-0050708-0051919 parallel parking you just spin and go directly in laughter so we've been working with a company to commercialize this my phd student ryan chin presented these early ideas two years ago at a tedx conference
KentLarson_2012X-0073190-0073722 what we need to do now develop things that can scale
KentLarson_2012X-0088314-0089316 we think we can also personalize sunlight that's sort of the ultimate personalization in some ways so we we've looked at articulating mirrors of the facade that can throw shafts of sunlight
KevinAllocca_2011Y-0005166-0005885 and of that only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment so how does it happen
KevinAllocca_2011Y-0024285-0024893 and if you think that that is weird you should know that there is a three hour version of this that's been viewed four million times
KevinBales_2010-0004276-0004944 how can i be like a hot shot young full professor who teaches human rights and not know this so it can't be true
KevinBales_2010-0012553-0012675 and met up with our film
KevinBales_2010-0022819-0023059 africa in the entire transatlantic slave
KevinBales_2010-0029304-0030661 but if corruption creeps in and people don't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law then if you can use violence if you can use violence with impunity you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery
KevinBales_2010-0036318-0036578 ten miles one hundred miles one thousand miles later
KevinBales_2010-0040169-0040639 even the business programs have started picking up on this i just want to share a little clip for
KevinBales_2010-0055998-0057240 they are basically the transport system on a quarry run by a slaveholder there are no roads there so they carry loads of stone on their backs often of their own weight up and down the himalayan mountains
KevinBales_2010-0070001-0070151 waiting for us to give it a big
KevinBales_2010-0083188-0083324 ten point eight billion dollars
KevinBales_2010-0095710-0096340 just begun to light up a little bit open up a little bit but when we went to speak with her when we took this photograph
KevinBales_2010-0103840-0104041 if we can't use it to bring slavery to
KevinBreel_2013X-0019731-0020062 i was suicidal and if you were to look at my life on the surface
KevinBreel_2013X-0038883-0039722 we are so so so accepting of any body part breaking down other than our brains and that's ignorance
KevinBreel_2013X-0058321-0058939 the world i believe in is one where i can look someone in the eye and say i'm going through hell
KevinKelly_2005-0011118-0011924 i like one of the definitions that alan kay has for technology he says technology is anything that was invented after you were born
KevinKelly_2005-0024102-0024399 what life there is on earth right now we have really no idea
KevinKelly_2005-0036202-0037392 those are the general approaches to life that's one way to look at life on earth today but a more interesting way the current way to take the long view is to look at it in an evolutionary
KevinKelly_2005-0049863-0051126 there is more and more co evolution and so the general long term trends of evolution are roughly these five ubiquity diversity specialization complexity and socialization
KevinKelly_2005-0070159-0070906 that you can actually look at this tree and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus
KevinKelly_2005-0088404-0089155 is the accumulation of ideas that's what it's for it's so that ideas don't die out and when we take that
KevinKelly_2005-0099535-0100214 so as it expands and as things expand what we have is the potential for differences diversity
KevinKelly_2005-0106070-0107297 whose technology of self expression has not yet been invented we have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference
KevinKelly_2005-0112031-0112984 our humanity is actually defined by technology all the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology this is the infinite game
KevinKelly_2007P-0005149-0005674 is amazing and we're not amazed it's really amazing that all this stuff is here
KevinKelly_2007P-0026919-0028237 the total traffic on this is running at seven terabytes per second brewster was saying the library of congress is about twenty terabytes so every second half of the library of congress is swooshing around in this machine
KevinKelly_2007P-0043913-0044660 machine and everything will go through the web and we're seeing that already with say phones right now phones don't go through the web but they are beginning to
KevinKelly_2007P-0057858-0059027 so that the laws of media such as the fact that copies have no value the value's in the uncopiable things the immediacy the authentication the personalization
KevinKelly_2007P-0071447-0072580 the second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages so in the old one if i wanted to go on to an airline web page i went from my computer to an ftp site to another
KevinKelly_2007P-0086491-0087781 so i'll give you one kind of an example there's like a billion social sites on the web each time you go into there you have to tell it again who you are and all your friends are why should you be doing that you should just do that once
KevinKelly_2007P-0102057-0102948 is happening with this is some kind of ai but it's not the ai in conscious ai as being an expert larry page told me that that's what they're trying to do and that's what they're trying to
KevinKelly_2007P-0116032-0116218 i appreciate your time
KevinKelly_2009X-0016750-0017691 and so they had minimal technology but they had some technology and if we study those hunter gatherer tribes and the neanderthal which are very similar to
KevinKelly_2009X-0029880-0030764 the other thing that the early man invented was fire and fire was used to clear out and again effected the ecology of grass and whole continents
KevinKelly_2009X-0043430-0044294 that's this world my working definition of technology is anything useful that a human mind makes it's not just hammers and gadgets like laptops
KevinKelly_2009X-0055759-0056729 the amount of energy is increasing through this little sequence and that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through life is actually greater
KevinKelly_2009X-0066466-0067267 or buy i use the word want technology wants this is a robot that wants to plug itself in to get more power your cat wants more food
KevinKelly_2009X-0084884-0085745 to eliminate malaria besides insect ddt impregnated mosquito nets but that's a really good idea that's a good job for technology
KevinKelly_2009X-0097533-0098357 and we can be part of it by aligning the technology that we make with it and i really appreciate your attention today thank you
KevinSlavin_2011G-0008359-0009267 the world around us and the world inside us and it's specifically algorithms which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff
KevinSlavin_2011G-0014450-0015086 but if you can take this big massive thing and you could turn it into
KevinSlavin_2011G-0027502-0028052 that are basically programmed to hide and a bunch of algorithms that are programmed to go find them and
KevinSlavin_2011G-0038052-0038386 the knife
KevinSlavin_2011G-0048481-0049450 it doesn't take away from the effects pragmatic chaos has pragmatic chaos like all netflix algorithms determines in the end sixty percent
KevinSlavin_2011G-0066555-0068294 you're a loser so if you were an algorithm you'd look for an architect like the one that i met in frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper throwing out all the furniture all the infrastructure for human use and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in
KevinSlavin_2011G-0076282-0076937 thirty seven times faster than you can click a mouse just for these algorithms just for the
KevinStone_2010U-0002671-0003550 and then developed an arthritic knee and i'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story and by the way i married a woman who has exactly the same story
KevinStone_2010U-0010582-0011336 and so the mission is how do i treat these things biologically and let's talk about both what i did for my wife and what i've done for hundreds of other patients
KevinStone_2010U-0026520-0027277 so in that case i have to design and we designed with uri galili and tom turek an enzyme wash to wash away
KevinStone_2010U-0039144-0039317 it's version two point
KevinSurace_2009-0014058-0014746 everything around us has to change or we're not going to lick this problem don't listen to the people who say you can't do this because anyone can and these job losses
KimGorgens_2010X-0007790-0008383 and then finally all suited up for the ninety minute drive to copper mountain so
KimGorgens_2010X-0025427-0026793 but kids are more vulnerable to brain injury in fact high school athletes are three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries relative even to their college age peers and it takes them longer to return to a symptom free baseline
KimGorgens_2010X-0037145-0037461 only my little boy's right there and he's like she's not
KimGorgens_2010X-0050720-0051504 as it turns out it occurred to tom that a twenty dollar helmet is a good way to protect one hundred thousand dollar graduate education
KiranBedi_2010W-0005801-0006489 my father defied his own grandfather almost to the point of disinheritance because he decided to educate
KiranBedi_2010W-0014538-0015269 comes out of those ninety points since i'm a product of this philosophy of ninety ten and secondly life on an incline
KiranBedi_2010W-0021910-0023221 so this was how it came into my service and it was different from the men i didn't want to make it different from the men but it was different because this was the way i was different and i redefined policing concepts in india
KiranBedi_2010W-0036718-0037671 same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten we converted this into a ashram from a prison to an ashram through education

KiranBirSethi_2009I-0013215-0014190 to experience what it means to be a child laborer it transformed them what you will see is their journey and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world
KiranBirSethi_2009I-0033243-0034378 india's first child friendly city so you're getting the pattern first two hundred children at riverside then thirty thousand children in ahmedabad and growing it was time now to infect india
KirbyFerguson_2012G-0003613-0004061 two thousand and four brian burton aka danger mouse
KirbyFerguson_2012G-0035090-0036316 and yet here is multi touch in action this is at ted actually about a year earlier this is jeff han and i mean that's multi touch it's the same animal at least let's hear what jeff han has to say about this newfangled technology
KirkCitron_2010-0007323-0008518 but the top story of this past year was the economy and i'm just betting that sooner or later this particular recession is going to be old news so what kind of stories might make a difference for the future
KristaTippett_2010Z-0006333-0007623 or happy endings or examples of self sacrifice that would seem to be too good to be true most of the time our cultural imagination about compassion has been
KristaTippett_2010Z-0024302-0025411 presence it's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there just showing up
KristaTippett_2010Z-0034801-0036724 matthew's legs don't work and he'll never walk again and and he does experience this as an and rather than a but and he experiences himself to be healed and whole and as a teacher of yoga he brings that experience to others across the spectrum of ability and disability health illness and aging
KristaTippett_2010Z-0051835-0052809 and i'll never forget hearing that story from dr rachel naomi remen who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her that in the beginning of the creation
KristaTippett_2010Z-0063139-0063878 but here's a face from twentieth century science that might surprise you in a discussion about compassion
KristaTippett_2010Z-0077883-0078567 we put these two photographs side by side on our website and someone said when i look at the first photo i ask myself what was he thinking
KristenAshburn_2003-0003132-0003779 the epidemic for instance this is herbert with his grandmother when i first met him
KristinaGjerde_2010Z-0002343-0003261 we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon it's a place of myth and legend it's a place marked on ancient maps as here be monsters
KristinaGjerde_2010Z-0008445-0009532 who have the resources to go out and exploit it so today i'm going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have
KristinaGjerde_2010Z-0015319-0016203 some of the problems we have to confront are that the current international laws for example shipping provide more protection to the areas closest to shore
KristinaGjerde_2010Z-0026935-0028173 we also spent many hours in the basements of the united nations trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed
KristinaGjerde_2010Z-0039944-0040857 but the sargasso sea the same way it aggregates sargassum weed actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region this picture
KristinaGjerde_2010Z-0053323-0054305 so what we need to do is to stand up boldly singly and together to push governments to push regional fisheries management organizations to declare our right
KristinaGjerde_2010Z-0068457-0069166 we have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader ocean basin wide initiative
KristinaGjerde_2010Z-0078747-0079949 tagged species throughout their life cycles in the open ocean we can also tag and track fishing vessels many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even
KwabenaBoahen_2007G-0001573-0002414 i got my first computer when i was a teenager growing up in accra and it was a really cool device you could
KwabenaBoahen_2007G-0015157-0016509 this is a picture of actually rory sayres girlfriend's brain rory is a graduate student at stanford he studies the brain using mri and he claims that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned
KwabenaBoahen_2007G-0024865-0025669 this huge network of cells interacting with each other about one hundred million of them sending about ten quadrillion of these pulses around every second
KwabenaBoahen_2007G-0033783-0034536 this is it's actually really this remarkable convergence between the devices that we use to compute
KwabenaBoahen_2007G-0045164-0045645 is that when the pore is open you get some current sometimes these are your ones but
KwabenaBoahen_2007G-0061084-0061839 so even when you go to these crappy devices where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero there's redundancy in the network that can actually
KwabenaBoahen_2007G-0075451-0076373 the retina chip extracts four different kinds of information it extracts regions with dark contrasts which will show up on the video as red
KwabenaBoahen_2007G-0092799-0093491 and i had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it it was very brute force it was very inelegant i don't think that
LZGranderson_2012X-0019209-0019580 that's when i got scared
LZGranderson_2012X-0033951-0035415 first started dating he told me this story about penguins and i didn't know where he was going with it at first he was kind of a little bit nervous when he was sharing it with me but he told me that when a penguin finds a mate that they want to

LakshmiPratury_2007-0005903-0006214 he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me
LakshmiPratury_2007-0015437-0016637 so what do i plan to leave for my son i collect autograph books and those of you authors in the audience know i hound you for them and cds too tracy i plan to publish
LaliteshKatragadda_2009I-0001635-0002511 two thousand and eight cyclone nargis devastated myanmar millions of people were in severe need of help
LaliteshKattragadda_2009I-0002591-0003713 the u n wanted to rush people and supplies to the area but there were no maps no maps of roads no maps showing hospitals no way for help to reach the cyclone victims
LarryBrilliant_2006-0001523-0002971 i got to see the last case of killer smallpox in the world i was in india this past year and i may have seen the last cases of polio in the world there's nothing that makes you feel more
LarryBrilliant_2006-0014127-0014635 we then got on two more buses and we drove through turkey and iran afghanistan
LarryBrilliant_2006-0027029-0028206 because it shows you to be the richest and the strongest and to be kings and queens of the world did not protect you from dying of smallpox never can you doubt that we are all in this together
LarryBrilliant_2006-0045111-0045892 twenty million people on the road at any time in buses and trains walking five hundred thousand villages one hundred and twenty million

LarryBrilliant_2006-0073352-0074238 and we conducted the first nepal survey ever done for health and the first nationwide blindness survey ever done and we had astonishing results
LarryBrilliant_2006-0085647-0086631 in influenza and i asked them the questions you'd like to ask them what do you think the likelihood is that there'll be a pandemic if it happens how bad do you think it will be
LarryBrilliant_2006-0097319-0097940 that's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic
LarryBrilliant_2006-0113184-0114079 and what i thought i would call it is early detection but it should really be called
LarryBrilliant_2006-0126314-0127180 using text messages or sms or instant messaging to find out from people who are within one hundred meters of the rumor that you hear if it is in fact
LarryBrilliant_2006-0136142-0136805 as ron st john i hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him when he started gphin
LarryBrilliant_2006-0143148-0143736 that turned out to be sars that's how the world found out about sars and because of that
LarryBrilliant_2007P-0003833-0004074 showing you an al gore movie that you may have seen before
LarryBrilliant_2007P-0019585-0019655 first of all

LarryBrilliant_2007P-0049745-0051136 will we become energized let's look at one case the case of bangladesh first even if carbon dioxide emissions stopped today global warming would continue
LarryBrilliant_2007P-0062663-0063351 as many as one hundred million refugees from bangladesh could be expected to migrate
LarryBrilliant_2007P-0074792-0075707 to remind ourselves we've been here before paralyzed by fear paralyzed into inaction when some
LarryBrilliant_2007P-0088429-0089354 building nine coal fired electrical plants that would have contributed to destroying the environment six months ago
LarryBrilliant_2007P-0101111-0102438 a beginning of understanding that we need to work not just on primary prevention of global warming but on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming on the poorest and the most vulnerable
LarryBrilliant_2007P-0113831-0114955 when we had almost eradicated smallpox it came back again because the company town of tatanagar drew laborers who could come there and get employment
LarryBrilliant_2007P-0124115-0124753 how can that not make you feel optimistic for the future thank you very much
LarryBurns_2005-0014194-0015157 we embodied all of the key components of a fuel cell propulsion system we then had autonomy drivable with hy wire and we showed hy wire here at this conference last year
LarryBurns_2005-0037173-0038210 we actually think the future's going to be event driven so since we can't predict the future we want to spend a lot of our time trying to create that future i'm very very intrigued by the fact that
LarryBurns_2005-0053449-0054359 and there's a simple principle of strategy that says do unto yourself before others do unto you if we can see this possible future others can too and we want to be the first
LarryLessig_2007-0010389-0010488 was that we would lose
LarryLessig_2007-0014397-0015526 never before in the history of human culture had it been as professionalized never before as concentrated never before has creativity of the millions been as effectively displaced
LarryLessig_2007-0020703-0020916 these instruments trespassers
LarryLessig_2007-0036609-0037423 and bmi was much more democratic in the art that it would include within its repertoire including african american music for the first time in the
LarryLessig_2007-0050354-0051735 access to this culture so let's have some very few examples to get a sense of what i'm talking about here here's something called anime music video first example taking anime captured from television re edited to music
LarryLessig_2007-0083222-0084355 there's a growing extremism that comes from both sides in this debate in response to this conflict between the law and the use of these technologies one side
LarryLessig_2007-0095606-0096291 the same thing can happen now we don't have a public domain to draw upon now so instead what we need is
LarryLessig_2007-0106631-0106976 and as we see what this technology can do we need to recognize
LarryLessig_2013-0004919-0005911 have this extraordinary power there are two elections every election cycle in lesterland one is called the general election the other is called the lester election
LarryLessig_2013-0021818-0023019 so i'm just a lawyer i look at this range of numbers and i say it's fair for me to say it's five percent who are our relevant funders in america in this sense the funders are our lesters
LarryLessig_2013-0039727-0040929 whatever one wants to say about lesterland against the background of its history its traditions in our land in usa land lesterland is a corruption a corruption
LarryLessig_2013-0053307-0054125 because in any system where the members are dependent upon the tiniest fraction of us for their election that means
LarryLessig_2013-0069145-0069501 turns out the analytics here are easy simple
LarryLessig_2013-0079124-0080912 fifty percent of the senate between one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and two thousand and four left to become lobbyists forty two percent of the house those numbers have only gone up and as united republic calculated last april the average increase in salary for those who they tracked was one thousand four hundred and fifty two percent
LarryLessig_2013-0088734-0089147 by being tedizens because
LarryLessig_2013-0101872-0102082 do you have that love do you
LarrySmith_2011X-0005936-0007634 there are great jobs and great careers and then there are the high workload high stress bloodsucking soul destroying kinds of jobs and practically nothing in between so the people looking for good jobs are going to fail i'm going to talk about those looking for great jobs
LarrySmith_2011X-0023393-0023969 people don't have passion
LarrySmith_2011X-0033836-0034265 passion is the thing that will
LarrySmith_2011X-0043094-0044661 after he got over his surprise at being you know turned down he concluded he'd had a narrow escape from marrying an irrational person although he did make a note to himself that the next time he proposed it was perhaps
LarrySmith_2011X-0057397-0059026 human relationships more than accomplishment i want to be a great friend i want to be a great spouse i want to be a great parent and i will not sacrifice them on the altar of great accomplishment
LarrySmith_2011X-0074777-0076224 there was something you could have said to your kid when he or she said i have a dream you could have said looked the kid in the face and said
LauraCarstensen_2011X-0001730-0002210 and societies are getting grayer you hear about it all the time
LauraCarstensen_2011X-0018192-0018864 aging brings some rather remarkable improvements increased knowledge expertise
LauraCarstensen_2011X-0031779-0032919 so that we could get a sense of the kinds of emotions and feelings they were having in their day to day lives and using this intense study of individuals we find that it's not
LauraCarstensen_2011X-0046920-0048834 process than negative emotions and so you switch to the positive emotions maybe our neural centers in our brain are degraded such that we're unable to process negative emotions anymore but that's not the case the most mentally sharp older adults are the ones who show this positivity effect
LauraCarstensen_2011X-0066726-0067544 can be better societies than we have ever known my father
LauraSnyder_2012G-0007478-0008499 the crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly a young cambridge scholar named william whewell stood up and quieted the audience
LauraSnyder_2012G-0014635-0015737 or the hired help of a nobleman like joseph priestley who was the literary companion to the marquis of lansdowne when he discovered oxygen
LauraSnyder_2012G-0033169-0034864 reading one of herschel's books was such a watershed moment for charles darwin that he would later say scarcely anything in my life made so deep an impression on me it made me wish to add my might to the accumulated store of natural knowledge
LauraSnyder_2012G-0047688-0048434 this is the one now at the computer history museum in california and it calculates accurately it actually works
LauraSnyder_2012G-0063877-0065221 eventually the royal society and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit and this has become fortunately it's become a major part of the scientific landscape today
LauraTrice_2008-0004312-0004703 and then my question became am i the only one who does this so i decided to investigate
LauraTrice_2008-0016660-0017650 go home and ask those questions and then help the people around you and it's simple and why should we care about this we talk about world peace how can we have world peace with different cultures different languages
LaurenZalaznick_2010W-0014329-0014730 you have power and you have the urge for acquisitiveness
LaurenZalaznick_2010W-0028027-0028898 and for the way in which i'm going to present the data i want to thank ted community superstar hans rosling who you may have just seen
LaurenZalaznick_2010W-0035294-0036994 but ronald reagan a telegenic president is in office it's trying to recover but look it can't aids iran contra the challenger disaster chernobyl moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from one thousand nine hundred and ninety for the next twenty years
LaurenZalaznick_2010W-0049143-0049326 seven of ten
LaurenZalaznick_2010W-0072418-0073442 murphy brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood this era's mom
LaurieGarrett_2007U-0011646-0012408 two years ago the migrating birds had a multiple event where thousands died because of a mutation occurring in the virus
LaurieGarrett_2007U-0025801-0027181 and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings fifty five percent of people who have become infected with h five n one have in fact succumbed and we don't have a huge number of people who got infected and never developed disease
LaurieGarrett_2007U-0044417-0045365 what do we do when we don't have any containment rooms with reverse air that will allow the healthcare workers to take care of patients these are in hong kong we have nothing like that here
LaurieGarrett_2007U-0059030-0059742 making matters worse and here is the other interesting thing when a human being ingests tamiflu only twenty percent is metabolized appropriately
LaurieGarrett_2007U-0073930-0074631 eighty to one hundred million people before we had commercial air travel so are we ready as a nation
LaurieGarrett_2007U-0090948-0091332 what factors determine the duration of a pandemic we don't really know i
LaurieGarrett_2007U-0107858-0108006 pretty severe
LaurieGarrett_2007U-0121111-0121970 and i would just add we saw the same thing with sars so what's going on here is your body says your immune system sends out all its
LaurieSantos_2010G-0026430-0027867 this means that your great great great great great great with about five million greats in there grandmother was probably the same great great great great grandmother with five million greats in there as holly up here you know so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant but albeit evolutionary relative
LaurieSantos_2010G-0048554-0049177 upon entering the market it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets because as the monkeys entered the door of the market
LaurieSantos_2010G-0065423-0066718 so imagine that right now i handed each and every one of you a thousand u s dollars so ten crisp hundred dollar bills take these put it in your wallet and spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it because it's yours now you can buy whatever you want donate it take it
LaurieSantos_2010G-0088358-0089599 the guy on the left is a safe bonus all the time he adds one to give the monkeys two the guy on the right is actually a risky bonus sometimes the monkeys get no bonus so this is a bonus of zero sometimes the monkeys get two extra
LaurieSantos_2010G-0107957-0108919 my guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving different financial decisions when you're watching your stocks plummet into the red when you're watching your house price go down
LawrenceLessig_2010X-0003038-0003790 indeed i was a conservative i was a young republican a teenage republican a leader in the teenage republicans indeed
LawrenceLessig_2010X-0010092-0010236 lawrence lessig right
LawrenceLessig_2010X-0018004-0018390 these very same people are strong believers in lots of
LawrenceLessig_2010X-0029170-0029412 so what he does is he begins to tell us about these
LawrenceLessig_2010X-0045879-0047110 dialogue between the videos where once the basic structure is established it becomes a kind of platform for articulating the similarities and differences between the groups social and physical worlds
LawrenceLessig_2010X-0059424-0059542 of creativity but
LawrenceLessig_2010X-0073322-0074237 stuff and not a generation of sharecroppers now i think there are lessons we should learn here
LawrenceLessig_2010X-0087727-0088615 i then got this email from youtube weirdly notifying me that there was content in that owned by the mysterious wmg
LawrenceLessig_2010X-0100450-0101013 me then my good old old days of right wing lunacy let me come back to now
LawrenceLessig_2010X-0110713-0110905 and maybe they'll do health care or
LeeCronin_2011G-0003874-0005793 and as an inorganic chemist my friends and colleagues make this distinction between the organic living world and the inorganic dead world and what i'm going to try and do is plant some ideas about how we can transform inorganic dead matter into living matter into inorganic biology
LeeCronin_2011G-0016191-0018022 so here's some inorganic life this is a dead crystal and i'm going to do something to it and it's going to become alive and you can see it's kind of pollinating germinating growing this is an inorganic tube and all these crystals here under the microscope were dead a few minutes ago and they look alive
LeeCronin_2011G-0033862-0035291 and so what we have here is a description of single cells replicating metabolizing burning through chemistries and so we have to understand that if we're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life we need to power it somehow
LeeCronin_2011G-0045844-0047173 these amino acids are combined and life begins but life begins what does that mean what is life what is this stuff of life so in the one thousand nine hundred and fifty s miller urey did their fantastic
LeeCronin_2011G-0064241-0065600 if we can somehow encourage these molecules to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete they will start to form cells that will replicate and compete if we manage to do that forget the molecular detail
LeeCronin_2011G-0080249-0081295 how improbable this is remember five billion years ago we were not here and there was no life so what will that tell us about the origin of life and the meaning of life
LeeCronin_2012G-0015074-0016821 so this allows you on the fly molecular assembly but perhaps for me the core bit going into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells with your genes and your environment and you print your own personal medicine and if that doesn't seem fanciful enough
LeeHotz_2010G-0008115-0009029 about forty five scientists from the university of wisconsin the desert research institute in nevada and others have been working to answer an essential question about global warming
LeeHotz_2010G-0014032-0015016 in blizzard winds the crew sling ropes between the tents so that people can feel their way safely to the nearest ice house and to the nearest outhouse
LeeHotz_2010G-0019063-0020228 ten times a day they extract the ten foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow season after season for thousands of years
LeeHotz_2010G-0029902-0030229 at depths where pressures can reach a ton per square inch
LeeHotz_2010G-0038512-0038816 and this is the object of their scrutiny but
LeeHotz_2010G-0048320-0049106 so that when their work gloves freeze and their fingers stiffen they can don a fresh pair they work against the clock and against the thermometer
LeeSmolin_2003-0001745-0002335 and somebody called howard burton came to me and said i represent a group of people
LeeSmolin_2003-0014913-0015302 for the tradition and community we a re in and rebellion that the community
LeeSmolin_2003-0027458-0028494 space and time and motion on the one hand and a society on the other hand were closely related and let me show you in a newtonian universe there a s no center
LeeSmolin_2003-0042842-0043795 this is quantum theory this is also if you talk to legal scholars the foundations of new ideas in legal thought they a re thinking about the same things and
LeeSmolin_2003-0056553-0057317 properties are relational now not only that but einstein taught us that gravity
LeeSmolin_2003-0069577-0070552 because you a re embedded in a network or relationships any actor in a democracy is embedded in a network of relationships and you understand some things better than other things
LemnSissay_2012X-0015103-0016902 reflects on what family truly is more than what it promotes itself to be that is they also use extraordinary skills to deal with extraordinary situations on a daily basis
LemnSissay_2012X-0029339-0031123 the adoptive parents were lined up it was the primary purpose of the social worker the aim to get the woman at her most vulnerable time in her entire life to sign the adoption papers so the adoption papers
LemnSissay_2012X-0045714-0046578 he found the foster parents and he said to them treat this as an adoption he's yours forever his name
LemnSissay_2012X-0061116-0062015 this was an opportunity the theology was perfect the timing unquestionable and the answer as honest as a sinner could get i mustn't love you i said to them

LemonAndersen_2011Y-0025384-0026450 you know what the problem is with you homie you don't read other people's poetry and you don't got any subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration
LemonAndersen_2011Y-0044331-0044745 that it was his father who gave it to my mother and that's a double entendre
LennartGreen_2005-0005646-0005926 the common the logic says you must turn the

LeonardSusskind_2011X-0002692-0004668 and i'm going to tell you the richard feynman that i knew i'm sure there are other people here who could tell you about the richard feynman they knew and it would probably be a different richard feynman richard feynman was a very complex man he was a man of many many parts he was of course foremost a very very very great scientist
LeonardSusskind_2011X-0026416-0026861 and they were full of all kinds of jargon i'm trying to remember the words
LeonardSusskind_2011X-0045577-0046458 and he said he had had basically exactly the same relationship with his father in fact he had been convinced at one
LeonardSusskind_2011X-0065645-0066938 so he sat down and i imagine he had nothing more than a simple piece of paper and a pencil and he tried to write down and did write down the simplest function that he could think of which had the boundary conditions
LeonardSusskind_2011X-0085019-0085887 i actually don't think feynman would have liked this event i think he would have said i don't need this but
LesleyHazleton_2010X-0014569-0014734 an advantage
LesleyHazleton_2010X-0023255-0024302 jesus god himself was utterly familar from his earlier manifestation as yahweh jealously insisting on no other gods
LesleyHazleton_2010X-0034939-0035568 believing men and believing women honorable men and honorable women
LesleyHazleton_2010X-0046111-0046807 as dark eyed maidens with swelling breasts or as fair high bosomed virgins
LesleyHazleton_2013G-0007142-0008343 this is the core mystical moment of islam and as such of course it defies empirical analysis yet the question wouldn't let go of me
LesleyHazleton_2013G-0025488-0026718 and that panicked disorientation that sundering of everything familiar that daunting awareness of something beyond human comprehension
LesleyHazleton_2013G-0041580-0042758 the heart of the matter abolish all doubt and what's left is not faith but absolute heartless conviction
LesleyHazleton_2013G-0065644-0066699 and i do this precisely because of the temptation to throw up my hands in resignation and retreat into silence because despair
LesleyHazleton_2013G-0077177-0078313 he'd call out terrorism for what it is not only criminal but an obscene travesty of everything he believed in and struggled
LeslieChang_2012G-0009444-0010990 in fact china makes goods for markets all over the world including its own thanks to a combination of factors its low costs its large and educated workforce and a flexible manufacturing system that responds quickly to market demands
LeslieChang_2012G-0023944-0024710 the workers rarely spoke about the products they made and they often had great difficulty explaining what exactly they did
LeslieChang_2012G-0037950-0038571 the workers i got to know had a curiously abstract relationship with the product of their labor
LeslieChang_2012G-0054885-0055984 and yet his view of the world persists and our tendency to see the workers as faceless masses to imagine that we can know what they're really thinking
LeslieChang_2012G-0070263-0071532 this purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine sitting in your office or in the library are not how you find them when you actually go out into the world thank you
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X-0003799-0004139 i'm not a psychiatrist a social worker
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X-0008657-0008893 more times than i can even remember
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X-0016252-0016827 in other words in families the last place we would want or expect to find violence
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X-0024109-0024911 and he looked like a farm boy he had these big cheeks these big apple cheeks and this wheat blond hair and he seemed so sweet
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X-0033328-0033819 where i lived what jobs i took who my friends were and where i spent christmas
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X-0041950-0042160 and my dream job
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X-0047011-0047292 and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X-0055435-0055800 it was an isolated incident and he was never going to hurt me again
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X-0062110-0062338 i didn't know he was abusing
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X-0069585-0069932 other outcomes include long term stalking
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X-0075756-0076969 we tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines self destructive women damaged goods the question why does she stay
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X-0079757-0080343 happy lives as employees wives and mothers lives completely free of violence
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X-0085056-0085398 there are several people listening to me right now
LeslieMorganSteiner_2012X-0090456-0090745 to understand the secrets of domestic
LewisPugh_2009G-0009896-0011291 i really really wanted to go to the arctic there was something about that place which drew me to it and well sometimes it takes a long time for a dream to come true but seven years ago i went to the arctic
LewisPugh_2009G-0021861-0022091 i'm sorry but there is no other way to describe it
LewisPugh_2009G-0035313-0036252 what had happened is that we are made partially of water and when water freezes it expands and so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers
LewisPugh_2009G-0048814-0050071 we carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the north pole and my close friend david saw the way i was thinking and he came up to me and he said lewis i've known you since you were eighteen years old
LewisPugh_2009G-0060661-0060917 sailing out of harbor now and it's at this stage
LewisPugh_2009G-0104948-0105627 i remember just a few years ago speaking about climate change and people heckling me in the back and saying it doesn't even
LewisPugh_2010G-0008695-0009703 and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water and that swim took me eighteen minutes and fifty seconds and it felt like eighteen days
LewisPugh_2010G-0024704-0024979 and when you're walking up the mountain to
LewisPugh_2010G-0035413-0035777 and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake
LewisPugh_2010G-0043129-0043238 swim breaststroke
LewisPugh_2010G-0053454-0053742 can you take in your relationship to the environment
LeymahGbowee_2012-0003854-0004047 as a research assistant
LeymahGbowee_2012-0014868-0015063 and bought her her first doll
LeymahGbowee_2012-0021492-0021643 i wish to be well
LeymahGbowee_2012-0022958-0024439 their father and mother died during the war she's nineteen her dream is to go to college to be able to support them she's highly athletic one of the things that happens is that she applies for a scholarship
LeymahGbowee_2012-0031194-0031414 in liberia for example
LeymahGbowee_2012-0038676-0038863 you unlock passion
LeymahGbowee_2012-0047806-0048164 several years ago there was one african girl
LeymahGbowee_2012-0057292-0057767 i don't have much to ask of you i've also been to places in this u s
LeymahGbowee_2012-0067165-0067764 right now in liberia what do you see as the main issue that troubles you
LeymahGbowee_2012-0077413-0077619 we went there to work with these girls
LisaBu_2013-0007175-0007705 only my friends supported me but they were kids just as powerless as i was
LisaBu_2013-0019840-0021420 a map actually carries somebody's view comparative reading actually is nothing new it's a standard practice in the academic world there are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature
LisaGansky_2011S-0007039-0008948 and as i think about the mesh and i think about well what's driving it how come it's happening now i think there's a number of vectors that i want to give you as background one is the recession that the recession has caused us to rethink our relationship with the things in our lives relative to the value so
LisaGansky_2011S-0018407-0019778 brings together these three things our ability to connect to each other most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are gps enabled and web enabled allows us to find each other and find things in time and space and third
LisaGansky_2011S-0034412-0036251 for zipcar and other mesh companies to actually just wow us to be like a concierge service because we give them so much information and they are entitled to really see how it is that we're moving they're in really good shape to anticipate what we're going to want next
LisaGansky_2011S-0052304-0052623 is to make sharing irresistible
LisaGansky_2011S-0067135-0067818 that space is not vital the areas around it lack vitality and vibrancy and engagement
LisaGansky_2011S-0081343-0082403 a very big bike sharing service they made a lot of mistakes they had some number of big successes but they were very transparent or they had to be in the way that they
LisaHarouni_2011S-0019455-0020435 and over time quite rapidly actually in a number of hours we can build a physical product ready to take out of the machine and use and this is quite
LisaHarouni_2011S-0031776-0032249 product designers or anyone who wanted to prototype a product and very quickly
LisaHarouni_2011S-0038386-0039264 which means it's a more efficient product you can't create this with standard manufacturing techniques even if you tried to do it manually
LisaHarouni_2011S-0049402-0050958 if i gave you a three d printer you wouldn't know how to direct it to make what you want it to but there are more and more technologies software and processes today that are breaking down those barriers i believe we're at a tipping point where this is now
LisaHarouni_2011S-0070171-0071817 what color that product will be perhaps what material and also you can engage in shape manipulation of that product but within boundaries that are safe because obviously the public are not professional product designers the piece of software will keep an individual within the bounds of the possible
LisaKristine_2012X-0006517-0007719 when my hand slips i suddenly remember a miner i had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft
LisaKristine_2012X-0017312-0017585 some i even considered like my second home
LisaKristine_2012X-0033223-0034255 every twenty minutes i'd have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it and as i sat there
LisaKristine_2012X-0047483-0047978 and they get paid for it and they do it in freedom
LisaKristine_2012X-0059274-0060969 recently the new york times reported that between one hundred thousand and three hundred thousand american children are sold into sex slavery every year it's all around us we just don't see
LisaKristine_2012X-0071770-0072424 often catch the fishing nets and weary frightened children are thrown into the water
LisaKristine_2012X-0087672-0088817 were full of enslaved people laboring many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold wading in water poisoned
LisaKristine_2012X-0098900-0099119 and the leg injury that you see here
LisaKristine_2012X-0113079-0113238 the beast of bondage
LisaMargonelli_2010X-0015247-0016152 and then the asphaltenes and this is the crucial thing the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves into a frothy emulsion something like mayonnaise it triples the amount
LisaMargonelli_2010X-0029802-0030567 and we want to be somewhere else we don't want to be buying oil we want to be doing something green and we get kind of in on our own con
LisaMargonelli_2010X-0045315-0046348 the whole oil industry into these ceos and we take it as you know we look at it on a moral level rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level and so
LisaMargonelli_2010X-0059902-0060941 which is two times the size of maryland has had thousands of oil spills a year i mean we've essentially been exporting oil spills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations
LisaMargonelli_2010X-0075086-0075876 and finally american families also pay a price for oil now on the one hand the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil
LisaMargonelli_2010X-0082976-0084163 what you see in this top drawing is a schematic of how petroleum gets used in the u s economy it comes in on the side the useful stuff is the dark gray and the unuseful stuff which is called the rejected energy
LisaMargonelli_2010X-0089584-0090172 we need to kind of rationalize this whole thing and you can find more about this policy it's called strong which is
LiuBolin_2013-0002453-0003540 by making myself invisible i try to explore and question the contradictory and often inter canceling relationship between our civilization and its development
LizColeman_2009-0013276-0013706 and the enhanced capacity for civic engagement that is their signature
LizColeman_2009-0023173-0024081 and more skepticism and move off the table in so doing the guardians of secular democracy in effect
LizColeman_2009-0038417-0039038 the corrupting of our political life had become a living nightmare nothing was exempt
LizColeman_2009-0050626-0051434 you can be sure jefferson knew what he was talking about when he said if a nation expects to be ignorant and free
LizColeman_2009-0064064-0064885 and the point is not to treat these topics as topics of study but as frameworks of action the challenge
LizColeman_2009-0076589-0077261 and when making connections is of the essence the power of technology emerges with special intensity
LizColeman_2009-0089048-0090184 on the cover of bennington's two thousand and eight holiday card is the architect's sketch of a building opening in two thousand and ten that is to be a center for the advancement of public action
LizColeman_2009-0098457-0099713 the problem is there is no such thing as a viable democracy made up of experts zealots politicians and spectators
LizDiller_2007P-0001678-0002699 aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space architecture is nothing but a special effects machine
LizDiller_2007P-0014404-0014944 that also challenges the conventions of space and skin and rethinks our dependence on vision
LizDiller_2007P-0030399-0031068 so it is sort of a theme but it goes a little bit you know deeper than that we really wanted
LizDiller_2007P-0042962-0043720 the problem of the retrospective was something we were very we were very uncomfortable with it's a kind of invention of the museum that's supposed to
LizDiller_2007P-0062254-0063508 in the institute of contemporary art in boston which is on the waterfront and there's not enough time to really introduce the building but i'll simply say that the building negotiates between this
LizDiller_2007P-0074857-0076224 is this mediatheque which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building so this is an eighty foot cantilever it's quite substantial so it's already sticking out into space enough and then from that is this
LizDiller_2007P-0080944-0082343 and here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence of the technological and the natural in the project but there is just no information it's just it's just hypnosis
LizDiller_2007P-0087072-0088096 hall and it's tucked under the juilliard building and descends several levels under the street so this is the entrance to tully hall as it used to be
LizDiller_2007P-0103143-0103825 just everything is lined it incorporates every single thing that you could possibly imagine is tucked into this high performance skin
LizDiller_2007P-0113906-0115174 just exude this glow temporarily stealing attention from the stage and this is tully in construction now i have no ending to say except that i'm a couple of minutes over thank you very much
LizDiller_2012-0012376-0012760 just defined by a line of buildings on either side
LizDiller_2012-0023098-0023994 together always and all the time there could be some very special relationship that could be forged here
LizDiller_2012-0031619-0033032 this is it this is the hirshhorn so a two hundred and thirty foot diameter concrete doughnut designed in the early seventy s by gordon bunshaft it's hulking it's silent it's cloistered it's arrogant it's a design challenge
LizDiller_2012-0044585-0044770 but more poetically
LizDiller_2012-0056417-0057746 so we strained it from the edges and we held it by cables it's a study of some bondage techniques which are actually very very important because it's hit by wind all the time there's one permanent steel ring at the top
LizaDonnelly_2010W-0002535-0002705 i was afraid of womanhood
LizaDonnelly_2010W-0010121-0010712 now when we're young we don't always know we know there are rules out there but we don't always know
LizaDonnelly_2010W-0017071-0017511 don't know what's going on half the time so it puts us in a very tenuous position
LizaDonnelly_2010W-0027504-0028732 in my forties i started thinking well why don't i do something i always loved political cartoons so why don't i do something with the content of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following as well as laugh
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G-0001664-0002516 show you how terrorism actually interacts with our daily life fifteen years ago i received a phone call from a friend
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G-0017282-0017941 known as a blocked democracy italy a country run by the same party for thirty five years was
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G-0031920-0032730 i interviewed mario moretti the head of the red brigades the man who kidnapped and killed aldo moro
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G-0047754-0048758 the sponsor and start funding themselves now again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities so
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G-0054165-0055016 this is an organization that can raise money across border but also that is able to carry out attacks in more than one country
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G-0063179-0063902 and the money laundering was taking place inside the united states the entry point of course of most of this money
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G-0074821-0075473 in the nineteen nineties was borrowing against the growth of the terror illegal and criminal economy
LorettaNapoleoni_2009G-0086032-0086238 why did this happen this happened because
LouieSchwartzberg_2011U-0006715-0007509 because we will protect what we fall in love with their relationship is a love story that feeds the earth
LouieSchwartzberg_2011X-0002376-0002831 and i didn't have a phone or tv but i had u s mail
LouieSchwartzberg_2011X-0032113-0032511 if you do nothing else but to cultivate
LouiseFresco_2009-0010315-0011086 the question is really why is this so and i think it is because we feel that this kind of
LouiseFresco_2009-0021710-0022485 all that is a real great improvement as we shall see of course we also particularly in the last decade
LouiseFresco_2009-0029644-0030418 few decades since the nineteen sixties food availability per head in this world has increased by twenty five percent
LouiseFresco_2009-0035142-0035911 to do other things to sit at ted meetings and not to worry about our food that is historically a really unique situation
LouiseFresco_2009-0049730-0051093 can you bake bread do you know how much a loaf of bread actually costs we have become very removed from what our bread really is which again evolutionarily speaking is very strange in fact not many of you know that
LouiseFresco_2009-0064370-0065447 the main driver of that is actually meat and meat consumption in southeast asia and china in particular is what drives the prices of cereals
LouiseFresco_2009-0077477-0078863 has this name of being bad of being about pollution about large scale about the destruction of the environment that is not necessary we need more science and not less and we need good science so what kind of science can we have well first of all
LouiseFresco_2009-0091081-0092345 talk to people in restaurants understand where you are in the food chain where your food comes from understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events and that frees you up to do other things
LouiseFresco_2009-0103128-0104020 first wheat varieties and to the farmers of today who've been making this and you don't even know who they are every meal you
LouiseLeakey_2008-0009382-0010268 that we evolved now i know that's a dirty word for some people but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas
LouiseLeakey_2008-0018465-0018638 at lake turkana on the west side
LouiseLeakey_2008-0023389-0024054 and slowly using dental picks and fine paintbrushes and all the sediment is then put through these screens
LouiseLeakey_2008-0028035-0028177 two million years ago
LouiseLeakey_2008-0038813-0039464 two million years ago at lake turkana homo erectus one of our human ancestors actually lived
LouiseLeakey_2008-0048093-0048620 and we dug up giant tortoises and elephants and things like that but when i was twelve as i was in this
LouiseLeakey_2008-0056935-0057822 and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles recognized it as being hominid
LouiseLeakey_2008-0065482-0065574 so homo erectus was
LouiseLeakey_2008-0076443-0077077 from very primitive beginnings with a very crude toolkit of stones we now have a
LouiseLeakey_2008-0087880-0088236 we have a common past and we share a common future
LucaTurin_2005-0004272-0005415 the eden top note is named after the eden project in the u k the lush heart note melaleuca bark note which does not contain any melaleuca bark because it a s totally forbidden
LucaTurin_2005-0015654-0016438 this has six carbon atoms so hexa hexanol it has one double bond it has an alcohol on the end so

LucaTurin_2005-0042875-0043698 nothing in the world has that frequency except s h if you look on this imagine a piano keyboard the s h stretch
LucaTurin_2005-0056439-0057822 now this is a spectroscope ok on my laboratory bench and it a s fair to say that if you look up somebody a s nose you a re unlikely to see anything resembling this and this is the main objection to the theory ok great we smell vibrations how
LucaTurin_2005-0069303-0070024 and then a magnificent thing happened i left academia and joined the real world of business and
LucaTurin_2005-0082609-0083707 one step i mean chemists have weird minds one step ninety percent yield you know and you get this lovely crystalline compound let us try it and i said first of all let me do the calculation
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G-0011091-0011801 however there's more to know about your parent star than just how much light you receive overall and i'll tell you why
LucienEngelen_2011X-0002009-0003738 and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients and one of the things we did at radboud university is we appointed a chief listening officer not in a very scientific way she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients family relatives
LucienEngelen_2011X-0010538-0010871 peer pressure used to help patients
LucienEngelen_2011X-0014441-0015210 and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect not only their own control again be captain of their own ship
LucienEngelen_2011X-0031452-0032185 and as of today we would like to introduce this not only as aed four eu which is what the product is called but also aed four us
LucyMcRae_2012-0014597-0015878 modify and biologically enhance it and how would that change the way that we communicate with each other or the way that we attract sexual partners and would we revert back to being more like animals more primal modes of communication
LudwickMarishane_2012S-0013953-0014194 fast forward four years later
LuisVonAhn_2011X-0011979-0013127 when i first heard this i was quite proud of myself i thought look at the impact that my research has had but then i started feeling bad see here's the thing each time you type a captcha essentially you waste ten seconds of your time
LuisVonAhn_2011X-0029377-0030593 the old captcha where people wasted their time to the new captcha where people are helping to digitize books so for example ticketmaster so every time you buy tickets on ticketmaster you help to digitize a book facebook every time you add a friend or poke somebody you help to digitize a book
LuisVonAhn_2011X-0053712-0054488 so i posed the question to my graduate student by the way you did hear me correctly his last name is hacker so i posed this question to him
LuisVonAhn_2011X-0080503-0081142 first of all people are really really learning a language we're mostly done building it and now we're testing it people really can learn a language with it
MaajidNawaz_2011G-0003614-0003959 my personal journey what brings me to the ted stage here today
MaajidNawaz_2011G-0014706-0015453 up until the last six months the people who have been capitalizing most on the age of behavior and the transnational allegiances using
MaajidNawaz_2011G-0022307-0022659 reputation we have from essex
MaajidNawaz_2011G-0030757-0030981 and identity and allegiances
MaajidNawaz_2011G-0040730-0041204 an example here at this stage if any of you remembers the christmas day bomb plot
MaajidNawaz_2011G-0055833-0057207 the assassination of benazir bhutto which means by definition that particular leader no longer exists one of the problems we're facing is in my view that there are no globalized youth led
MaajidNawaz_2011G-0071422-0072188 and inevitably they fail or inevitably they make political mistakes democracy takes the blame for their political mistakes
MaajidNawaz_2011G-0081965-0082725 neoconservatism had the philosophy that you go in with a supply led approach to impose democratic values from the top down
MaajidNawaz_2011G-0087904-0088782 without freedom of belief you don't have the right to join organizations so what's needed is those organizations on the ground advocating for the democratic culture itself
MaajidNawaz_2011G-0096117-0096483 now to conclude how does that happen well
MadeleineAlbright_2010W-0005256-0006823 which he deserved he had invaded another country and so all of a sudden a poem appeared in the papers in baghdad comparing me to many things but among them an unparalleled serpent and so i happened to have a snake pin so i wore it when we talked about iraq
MadeleineAlbright_2010W-0039748-0041288 the bottom line that i decided was actually women's issues are the hardest issues because they are the ones that have to do with life and death in so many aspects and because as i said it is really central to the way that we think about things now
MadeleineAlbright_2010W-0070448-0071184 women to be in political office to figure out how they can in fact develop political voices
MaeJemison_2002-0013810-0014959 alvin ailey's suite otis or sarah jones your revolution will not be between these thighs which by the way is banned by the fcc or ska all of these things without question
MaeJemison_2002-0027402-0028193 when we attempt to accommodate it in our world and we try to build our foundation for the world we're messing up the future because who wants to be
MaeJemison_2002-0039639-0040362 and i found myself the last quarter juggling chemical engineering separation processes logic classes nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
MaeJemison_2002-0055115-0056401 the difference between science and the arts is not that they are different sides of the same coin even or even different parts of the same continuum but rather they are manifestations of the same thing
MagnusLarsson_2009G-0001648-0002676 to be at a conference dedicated to things not seen and present my proposal to build a six thousand kilometer long wall across the entire african continent
MagnusLarsson_2009G-0014462-0015580 this is a catastrophe waiting to happen again and it's one that gets very little attention in our accelerated media culture desertification is simply too slow to reach the headlines
MagnusLarsson_2009G-0028698-0030066 four years ago twenty three african countries came together to create the great green wall sahara a fantastic project the initial plan called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted right across the african continent from mauritania in the west
MagnusLarsson_2009G-0045008-0046301 not an economist very much not but i did quite literally a back of the envelope calculation and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete we would have to pay in the region of ninety dollars
MagnusLarsson_2009G-0059784-0059885 in a period of
MairaKalman_2007-0004319-0005553 so i was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child my older sister was busy torturing my parents and they were busy torturing her
MairaKalman_2007-0018549-0019491 we would create a series of products and some of the watches there attempting to be beautiful and humorous maybe not attempting hopefully succeeding
MairaKalman_2007-0029436-0029739 in writing for children it seems simple
MairaKalman_2007-0036180-0036989 because my life is too random and too confused and i enjoy it that way but anyway so i was in we were in venice
MairaKalman_2007-0042761-0043931 we hoped we'd be funny but we didn't know it would be a cover and we didn't know that that image at the moment that it happened would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people and it really became the
MairaKalman_2007-0056375-0057449 could should or would should could and would is coco chanel's lover should is edith sitwell and could is an august sander subject and he noticed a large stain in the center of the rug
MairaKalman_2007-0069718-0070457 and then he died and there was no more spinoza extinct and then we don't have a stuffed spinoza but we do have a stuffed pavlov's dog
MairaKalman_2007-0079997-0081278 but actually it's not it's actually a wonderful thing but then she says tel aviv and lenin which is the town they came from and sorry the rest unknown thank you but in her lexicon means sorry the rest unknown is sorry the rest unknown go to hell because she couldn't care less
MairaKalman_2007-0093348-0093421 used
MajoraCarter_2006-0001645-0002633 if you're here today and i'm very happy that you are you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves however when we're not at ted
MajoraCarter_2006-0022790-0023805 these impacts are coming everyone's way and we all pay dearly for solid waste costs health problems associated with pollution and more odiously the cost of imprisoning our young black and latino men
MajoraCarter_2006-0035817-0036520 many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions
MajoraCarter_2006-0042205-0043029 that home and the love inside of it along with help from teachers mentors and friends along the way was enough now why is this story important
MajoraCarter_2006-0050529-0051351 and as redesigned by matthews nielsen landscape architects and once this path is constructed it'll connect the south bronx with more than four hundred acres of randall's island park
MajoraCarter_2006-0064841-0065662 both hotbeds of cultural innovation think hip hop and jazz both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another
MajoraCarter_2006-0080484-0081226 i am not anti development ours is a city not a wilderness preserve and i've embraced my inner capitalist and
MajoraCarter_2006-0093738-0094740 that development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the us but bogota's example has the power to change that
MajoraCarter_2006-0107721-0108642 who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world we might have come to this conference from very very different stations in life
MajoraCarter_2010X-0014102-0015110 consumption is used to pump water into mostly southern california their spending loads loads to channel that rainwater out into the ocean when it rains and floods as well
MajoraCarter_2010X-0028373-0029364 and judy saw her landscape being destroyed and her water poisoned and the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied leaving even more unemployment in their wake
MajoraCarter_2010X-0037926-0038491 but just a few months ago judy was diagnosed with stage three lung cancer
MajoraCarter_2010X-0044174-0044850 meet and learn from in the examples of the work that i do now i was really lucky to have them all featured on my corporation for public radio
MajoraCarter_2010X-0053909-0054989 or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell we can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing
MajoraCarter_2010X-0069980-0070782 so i'm hoping you can see a little theme here these examples indicate a trend i haven't created it and it's not happening by accident
MajoraCarter_2010X-0083505-0084340 or someone else's would just happen to coincide with his lucky day so you need to help him out and sometimes i would loan him money from my after school or
MajoraCarter_2010X-0097510-0098591 deficit with speaking fees and i think because early on frankly my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time but since then the park that was just a dump and was featured at a ted two thousand and six talk
MalcolmGladwell_2004-0003538-0003686 i think would make my mother happy
MalcolmGladwell_2004-0011189-0012001 in white plains new york and one of his first clients was this is many years ago back in the early seventies one of his first clients was pepsi
MalcolmGladwell_2004-0022323-0022509 this experiment with diet pepsi
MalcolmGladwell_2004-0032226-0033072 next to ragu which was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the seventies and eighties now in the industry i don't know whether you care about this or how much time i have to go into this but
MalcolmGladwell_2004-0046473-0047127 and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce you realize that all americans fall into one of three groups
MalcolmGladwell_2004-0052776-0053979 we've been thinking all wrong and that's when you started getting seven different kinds of vinegar and fourteen different kinds of mustard and seventy one different kinds of olive oil and then eventually even ragu
MalcolmGladwell_2004-0063892-0063982 what you want in a coffee
MalcolmGladwell_2004-0072984-0074028 bottle the way the french's and gulden's did they decided to charge four dollars and then they had those ads right with the guy in the rolls royce and he's eating the grey poupon the other rolls royce pulls up and he says do you have any grey poupon
MalcolmGladwell_2004-0084430-0085221 and she serves it that way time and time again and if you quarrel with her she will say you know what you're wrong
MalcolmGladwell_2004-0093276-0094306 that changed right what is the great revolution in science of the last ten fifteen years it is the movement from the search for universals to the understanding of variability
MalcolmGladwell_2004-0102341-0103255 the difference between coffee at sixty and coffee at seventy eight is a difference between coffee that makes you wince and coffee that makes you
MalcolmGladwell_2011G-0014293-0015853 in any case carl norden emigrates to the united states just before the first world war and sets up shop on lafayette street in downtown manhattan and he becomes obsessed with the question of how to drop bombs from an airplane
MalcolmGladwell_2011G-0022697-0024031 and then they plug in the altitude of the plane the speed of the plane the speed of the wind and the coordinates of the target and the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb
MalcolmGladwell_2011G-0028989-0030082 and the u s military spends one point five billion dollars billion dollars in one thousand nine hundred and forty dollars developing the norden bombsight and to put that in perspective
MalcolmGladwell_2011G-0048068-0049056 so they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds and the norden bombsight doesn't work as well under those conditions but most of all the norden bombsight
MalcolmGladwell_2011G-0065934-0067819 those surface to air missiles that the iraqis were launching at the israelis the mission of the two squadrons was to get rid of all the scud missile launchers and so they flew missions day and night and they dropped thousands of bombs and they fired thousands of missiles in an attempt to get rid of this particular scourge
MalcolmGladwell_2011G-0081197-0082092 the issue isn't the accuracy of the bombs you have it's how you use the bombs you have and more importantly whether you ought to use bombs at all
MalcolmGladwell_2013S-0008236-0009339 forests of oak and wheat fields and vineyards but more importantly though in the history of that region it's served it's had a real strategic function
MalcolmGladwell_2013S-0021266-0022570 and finally the only person who will come forward is this young shepherd boy and he goes up to saul and he says i'll fight him and saul says you can't fight him that's ridiculous you're this kid this is this mighty warrior
MalcolmGladwell_2013S-0040569-0042450 there's heavy infantry which are foot soldiers armed foot soldiers with swords and shields and some kind of armor and there's artillery and artillery are archers but more importantly slingers and a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch with two long cords attached to it
MalcolmGladwell_2013S-0058802-0060705 fight him in hand to hand combat infantry on infantry but david has absolutely no expectation he's not going to fight him that way why would he he's a shepherd he's spent his entire career using a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves that's where his strength lies
MalcolmGladwell_2013S-0080006-0081437 he had acromegaly do you remember the wrestler andre the giant famous he had acromegaly there's even speculation that abraham lincoln had acromegaly anyone who's unusually tall that's the first explanation we come up with
MalcolmLondon_2013S-0004680-0006268 masculinity mimicked by men who grew up with no fathers camouflage worn by bullies who are dangerously armed but need hugs teachers paid less than what it costs them to be here oceans of adolescents come here to receive lessons
MallikaSarabhai_2009I-0008435-0009629 so the god vishnu arrived are there any witnesses just a one eyed monkey said the brahmin now the one
MallikaSarabhai_2009I-0018495-0019216 look around you look at your own countries there is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes
MallikaSarabhai_2009I-0032955-0033645 he came to talk to her and said what is this about she told him and he set out the first inquiry into what today we
MallikaSarabhai_2009I-0052252-0052291 and
MallikaSarabhai_2009I-0076715-0077877 spawned thousands of young people wanting to volunteer for social change in venezuela one of the most popular soap operas has a heroine called crystal and when onscreen crystal got breast cancer

MalteSpitz_2012G-0040265-0040669 it's about all of us first it's only like

ManalAlSharif_2013G-0021844-0022149 but there is no law banning you from driving
ManalAlSharif_2013G-0048745-0050602 to question these rules so for me it wasn't only about these attacks i had to face it was about living two totally different perceptions of my personality of my person the villain back in my home country and the hero outside
MarcGoodman_2012G-0004009-0005766 and that's informed my perspective on things i've been a street police officer an undercover investigator a counter terrorism strategist and i've worked in more than seventy countries around the world i've had to see more than my fair share of violence and the darker underbelly of society
MarcGoodman_2012G-0018690-0020431 but heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations guns and bombs are nothing new what was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims and slaughter them
MarcGoodman_2012G-0029833-0030811 where the terrorist war room googled him and found a picture and called their operatives on the ground and said your hostage is he heavyset
MarcGoodman_2012G-0041070-0041416 with openness
MarcGoodman_2012G-0049067-0050249 and cute they don't all have drumsticks some can be armed with hd cameras and do countersurveillance on protesters or as in this little bit of movie magic quadcopters can be
MarcGoodman_2012G-0063470-0065042 the internet of things to be hacked all of the physical objects in our space are being transformed into information technologies and that has a radical implication for our security because more connections to more devices means more vulnerabilities
MarcGoodman_2012G-0079869-0080341 dna sequencing is proceeding at a pace five times that of moore's law
MarcGoodman_2012G-0090215-0090845 how will we protect them in the future what to do
MarcGoodman_2012G-0108447-0109591 i can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are my personal belief is that rather than having a small elite force of highly trained government agents here to protect us all
MarcKoska_2009G-0007323-0008379 blindly giving an injection to someone and the injection is so valuable that the people basically trust the doctor being second to god which i've heard many times
MarcKoska_2009G-0014684-0015421 and then they repackage them and sell them out on markets for literally more money than a sterile syringe in the first place which is quite bizarre
MarcKoska_2009G-0020707-0021485 and they use them in the breaks for water pistols they squirt them at each other which is lovely and innocent and they are having great fun but they also drink from
MarcPachter_2008P-0005474-0006616 and so i came up with the idea of the living self portrait series and the living self portrait series was the idea of basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people who would come and i would interview
MarcPachter_2008P-0017790-0019026 this is somewhat against resistance and caginess on the part of the interviewee then there's the celebrity interview where it's more important who's asking the question than who answers that's barbara walters and
MarcPachter_2008P-0029307-0030587 i didn't know what was going on but i was so part of the process of getting that out so i thought okay fine i've got empathy or empathy at any rate is what's critical to this kind of interview
MarcPachter_2008P-0043186-0044087 to listen to them and they sit there and they say aw shucks it was an accident there's nothing that ever happens that justifies people taking
MarcPachter_2008P-0054577-0055317 woman named clare boothe luce it'll be your generational determinant as to whether her name means much to you
MarcPachter_2008P-0066963-0067589 for that and so then i asked her a question i didn't know how i was going to get out of it i asked her a question about
MarcPachter_2008P-0079484-0080560 and this is just a brief reference it wasn't this arm wrestle but it was a little surprising for the person involved i interviewed steve martin it wasn't all that long ago
MarcPachter_2008P-0085953-0086751 the key that's going to allow this to proceed now these are arm wrestle questions but i want to tell you about
MarcPachter_2008P-0092311-0092861 and here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering jefferson and connecting with him
MarcPachter_2008P-0104527-0105789 dark rambling new york apartment and she called out to me and she was in bed i had known that she had had a stroke and that was some ten years before and so she spent almost all of her life in bed
MarcPachter_2008P-0118144-0119314 of the beautiful one for whom all the ballet lessons were given and she had to go along just to be with her sister for company and in that process she made a number of decisions
MarcelDicke_2010G-0007131-0008139 of all animals on earth of all animal species eighty percent walks on six legs but if we would count all the individuals and take an average weight of them
MarcelDicke_2010G-0022555-0023569 and now you may think okay in this provincial town in china they're doing that but not us well we've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally
MarcelDicke_2010G-0037373-0038048 for you and me for everyone on this earth the human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially
MarcelDicke_2010G-0055565-0056319 we eat insects they're so distantly related from us that this doesn't happen so that's one point for insects
MarcelDicke_2010G-0071250-0072425 you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by seventy percent we're not going to make it that way we could much better from meat from beef to insects
MarcelDicke_2010G-0077576-0078784 or crabs or crayfish are very closely related they are delicacies in fact a locust is a shrimp of the land and it would make very good into our
MarcelDicke_2010G-0091678-0092120 she went to a high class restaurant and they ate insects all together
MarcinJakubowski_2011U-0014349-0015811 we know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity and the same is starting to happen with hardware too we're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people's lives in such tangible material ways

MarcoTempest_2011G-0022807-0023686 our self deception becomes a positive illusion why movies are able to take us onto extraordinary adventures
MarcoTempest_2012-0007715-0008288 it was the poet samuel taylor coleridge who first suggested this receptive state
MarcoTempest_2012G-0003113-0003603 to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced
MarcoTempest_Session4_2012-0015003-0015550 but how could he convince the public that the millions of volts required to make
MarcoTempest_Session7_2011G-0011749-0012371 wake up
MarcusByrne_2012X-0021772-0022124 to investigate how dung beetles
MarcusByrne_2012X-0037333-0039002 but the sun is at the horizon over here and we know that when the sun is at the horizon say it's over on this side there is a north south a huge pathway across the sky of polarized light that we can't see that the beetles can see
MarcusByrne_2012X-0062625-0064317 and mine and what's of interest here is that little brain is quite cool but if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment look at the temperature of the soil it's up around fifty five to sixty degrees centigrade watch how often the beetle dances
MarcusByrne_2012X-0089199-0089741 he displaces the beetle and now we have to see
MarcusduSautoy_2009G-0002148-0002484 thirty two a gunshot was heard ringing out
MarcusduSautoy_2009G-0020762-0021749 it is written in mathematical language and the letters are triangles circles and other geometric figures without which means that it's humanly impossible to comprehend a single
MarcusduSautoy_2009G-0042510-0043767 so let's take these two symmetrical objects here let's take the twisted six pointed starfish what can i do to the starfish which makes it look the same well there i rotated it by a sixth of a turn and still it looks like it did before i started
MarcusduSautoy_2009G-0055578-0056391 but how they interact with each other which really characterizes the symmetry of an object if i do one magic trick move followed by another
MarcusduSautoy_2009G-0062333-0063272 and then the sixth of a turn of course it doesn't make any difference it still ends up at half a turn and there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other
MarcusduSautoy_2009G-0068413-0069475 you can try this when you go down to the pub later on take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn then flip it and then do it in the other order and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction
MarcusduSautoy_2009G-0085447-0086157 but these are things that we can see and the power of galois mathematical language is it also allows us to create symmetrical objects
MarcusduSautoy_2009G-0099695-0100753 during the twenty up again okay if i told you twenty or less stand up because this one i think there were a few here the people who just last sat down okay how many digits do you have in your number
MargaretHeffernan_2012G-0011570-0011803 life had they started school
MargaretHeffernan_2012G-0028152-0029602 he saw his job as creating conflict around her theories because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong that george could give alice the confidence she
MargaretHeffernan_2012G-0046753-0047127 eighty five percent
MargaretHeffernan_2012G-0060087-0060464 joe was what a lot of people might think of
MargaretHeffernan_2013X-0003625-0003831 and
MargaretHeffernan_2013X-0020559-0021979 when she figured out the puzzle she started telling everyone she could what had happened what had been done to her parents and to the people that she saw on oxygen tanks at home in the afternoons
MargaretHeffernan_2013X-0037387-0037542 not to know
MargaretHeffernan_2013X-0048827-0049845 and the truth is this is a human problem we're all under certain circumstances willfully blind
MargaretHeffernan_2013X-0063988-0065150 and i asked him why he did it and he said well it was really my daughter who prompted me to do it she came up to me one night and she just said dad you can't let the kids die
MargaretHeffernan_2013X-0078604-0079765 when i went to libby montana i visited the asbestosis clinic that gayla benefield brought into being
MargaretStewart_2010U-0008382-0009265 well it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database along with a usage policy that tells us what to do when we find a match
MargaretStewart_2010U-0025367-0026158 it's truly an ecosystem of culture because it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios but sometimes big studios borrowing back
MargaretWertheim_2009-0009118-0009993 two or three feet high this is some more images of it that one on the right is about five feet high the work involves hundreds of different crochet models
MargaretWertheim_2009-0015510-0016037 we have a new organization together called the institute for figuring which is a little organization we started to promote
MargaretWertheim_2009-0021305-0022349 i've written books about the history of space the history of physics and religion and i write articles for people like the new york times and the l a times so i had no idea what it meant to fill a three thousand square foot gallery
MargaretWertheim_2009-0032959-0034135 and the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet it happens to be a fact it's almost impossible to model this structure any other way and it's almost impossible to do it on computers
MargaretWertheim_2009-0047301-0048554 a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw so it's like the equator or the lines of longitude so we ask the question again how many straight lines can i draw through the point but never meet the original line
MargaretWertheim_2009-0059744-0060477 in wool through a domestic feminine art is the proof that the most famous postulate in mathematics is wrong
MargaretWertheim_2009-0072397-0073061 setness of the mathematical code that underlies is the simple algorithm crochet three increase one
MargaretWertheim_2009-0083563-0084437 one of the ways that we've come to think about this is that what we're trying to do with the institute for figuring and projects like this we're trying to have kindergarten for grown ups
MariaBezaitis_2013S-0009055-0010409 and that means that our digital relations now depend extraordinarily on technology to bring to them a sense of robustness a sense of discovery a sense of surprise and unpredictability
MariaBezaitis_2013S-0023634-0025270 my colleagues and i at intel have spent the last few years looking at the ways in which digital platforms are reshaping our everyday lives what kinds of new routines are possible we've been looking specifically at the kinds of digital platforms that have enabled us to take our possessions
MariaBezaitis_2013S-0039235-0040775 whether you're a political party insisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion of who belongs and who does not whether you're the government protecting social institutions like marriage and restricting access of those institutions to the few
MarianBantjes_2010-0005522-0006468 so i am one of those people with a transformative personal story six years ago after twenty years in graphic design and typography
MarianBantjes_2010-0016920-0017330 is there a sense of wonder and does it invoke curiosity
MarianBantjes_2010-0030320-0030725 so ultimately my goal is to create something unexpected
MarianBantjes_2010-0040683-0041484 so i'm currently working on a book which plays with both senses of the word as i explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in
MarianBantjes_2010-0051098-0051727 and i started by doing just a single image like this and sending them out to each person but in
MarianBantjes_2010-0065629-0066187 time spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds but without the scratches and bird shit
MarianBantjes_2010-0078655-0079075 the conditions i work under and the audience that i'm able to reach
MarianBantjes_2010-0082184-0083134 it's very very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we're not contributing enough
MarianBantjes_2010-0087684-0087947 that i'm seeding the imagination of the populace
MarisaFickJordan_2007G-0008935-0009273 away from the ethnic a little bit more contemporary
MarisaFickJordan_2007G2-0008999-0010072 so i developed a whole range around mass produced range that obviously fitted into a much higher end decor market that could be exported and also service our local
MarkApplebaum_2012X-0014066-0014885 so here we have this piece of music by beethoven and my problem with it is it's boring i mean you
MarkApplebaum_2012X-0047720-0049396 and so that's pushed me to do other projects like this one this is an excerpt from a score called the metaphysics of notation the full score is seventy two feet wide it's a bunch of crazy pictographic notation let's zoom in on one section of it right here you can see it's rather detailed
MarkApplebaum_2012X-0060926-0062673 here's another example from another piece and then its realization so in these two capacities i've been scavenger in the sense of taking like the subway map right or thief maybe and i've also been designer in the case of making the wristwatches and once again this is for me interesting
MarkApplebaum_2012X-0097330-0097995 obsessive behavior and there was some delusional behavior and things like that and here i think we could say that this is an argument for
MarkBezos_2011U-0013956-0014140 i carried my payload
MarkBittman_2007P-0011395-0012048 livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation air and water pollution water shortages
MarkBittman_2007P-0025040-0026220 but back to animals and junk food what do they have in common one we don't need either of them for health we don't need animal products and we certainly don't need white bread or coke
MarkBittman_2007P-0039523-0040477 go there and back five times there and back now my math's a little shaky but this is pretty good and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long but you get the idea
MarkBittman_2007P-0052914-0053792 back in those days before even julia back in those days there was no philosophy of food you just ate you didn't claim to be anything
MarkBittman_2007P-0071358-0071550 someone had to eat all that stuff
MarkBittman_2007P-0082351-0082991 sadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed the beginning
MarkBittman_2007P-0092997-0094147 and it's killed down there and then flown five thousand miles whatever dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere i don't know packed in styrofoam of course
MarkBittman_2007P-0103865-0104648 the industry obsessed usda recommends but listen experts who are serious about disease reduction
MarkBittman_2007P-0110763-0111360 it would seem absurd but that's exactly what should happen and what progressive
MarkBittman_2007P-0116945-0118280 we can continue to enjoy our food and we continue to eat well and we can eat even better we can continue the search for the ingredients we love and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals
MarkForsyth_2012X-0015038-0016138 and you know it could have worked and everybody got insanely bored actually because this debate went on for three weeks i read a diary of this poor senator who just keeps coming back still on this subject
MarkForsyth_2012X-0030745-0031933 but the third thing you can learn and this is the really important one this is the point i want to leave you on is that the title president of the united states of america doesn't sound that humble at all
MarkPagel_2011G-0001917-0002352 dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised
MarkPagel_2011G-0017426-0018683 now these chimpanzees are using tools and we take that as a sign of their intelligence but if they really were intelligent why would they use a stick to extract termites from the ground rather than a shovel
MarkPagel_2011G-0030770-0032161 the surprise really is that all of the other animals really cannot do that at least not very much and even this picture has the suspicious taint of being rigged about it something from a barnum bailey circus
MarkPagel_2011G-0044142-0045240 if i can learn by watching you i can steal your best ideas and i can benefit from your efforts without having to put in the time and energy that you did into developing them
MarkPagel_2011G-0055798-0056170 well we chose the second option
MarkPagel_2011G-0076282-0077723 it is the most valuable trait we have for converting new lands and resources into more people and their genes that natural selection has ever devised language really is the voice of our genes
MarkPagel_2011G-0093815-0094883 these different languages impose a barrier as we've just seen to the transfer of goods and ideas and technologies and wisdom and they impose a barrier to cooperation
MarkPagel_2011G-0108400-0110050 our modern world now is confronting us with a dilemma and it's the dilemma that this chinese man faces who's language is spoken by more people in the world than any other single language and yet he is sitting
MarkRoth_2010-0008615-0009122 de animate them a bit so they're a little more immortal when they have that heart attack
MarkRoth_2010-0020103-0020606 ten years ago there was a skier in norway that was trapped in an icy waterfall
MarkRoth_2010-0033751-0035058 they were in suspended animation and we could bring them back to life without any harm and this precise oxygen concentration ten parts per million that caused suspended animation is conserved
MarkRoth_2010-0049024-0049744 we tried many different chemicals and agents and we failed over and over again so one time i was at home
MarkRoth_2010-0059351-0060472 basis for thinking why you might want to do this as i said this agent is in us and in fact here's a curious thing it binds to the very place inside of your cells where oxygen binds
MarkRoth_2010-0068584-0069417 it appeared dead it's oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold and here's the really important point
MarkRoth_2010-0075945-0076962 so we wondered can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility and
MarkRoth_2010-0092763-0093761 you the phase one safety studies are over and we're doing fine we're now moved on we have to get to phase two and phase three it's going to take us a few years this has all moved very quickly
MarkRoth_2010-0104808-0105208 they will have the time that will buy them the time to be transported to the hospital
MarkShaw_2013-0008924-0009109 and we've coated one of the gloves
MarkShaw_2013-0025218-0026072 it could be anything that's anti icing because if you don't have water you don't have ice it could be anti corrosion
MarkhamNolan_2012S-0012002-0013882 to give an example of how we rely on the audience on the fifth of september in costa rica an earthquake hit it was a seven point six magnitude it was fairly big and sixty seconds is the amount of time it took for it to travel two hundred and fifty kilometers to managua so the ground shook in managua sixty seconds after it hit the epicenter
MarkhamNolan_2012S-0032031-0032338 if you know how to use it because there is so much on twitter
MarkhamNolan_2012S-0047068-0048656 the first one was called spokeo which allowed us to look for rita krills so we looked all over the u s we found them in new york we found them in pennsylvania nevada and florida so we went and we looked for a second free internet tool called wolfram alpha and we checked the weather reports for the day in which this video had been uploaded
MarkhamNolan_2012S-0068886-0070851 and it's got the black and white curbs that we saw in the video and as we click through it you can see someone's uploaded photos to go with the map which is very handy so we click into the photos and the photos start showing us more detail that we can cross reference with the video the first thing that we see is we see black and white curbing which is handy because we've seen that before
MarkusFischer_2011G-0007192-0007730 that is able to fly over your heads so be careful later on
MarlaSpivak_2013G-0007713-0009425 now this business of hand pollination is actually not that uncommon tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers with a hand held vibrator now this one's the tomato tickler laughter now this is because
MarlaSpivak_2013G-0020547-0022446 and even stranger there were these people these beekeepers that loved their bees like they were family and when i put down the book i knew i had to see this for myself so i went to work for a commercial beekeeper a family that owned two thousand hives of bees in new mexico and i was permanently hooked
MarlaSpivak_2013G-0035805-0037350 bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes and i'll go through each of these the bottom line is bees dying reflects a flowerless landscape and a dysfunctional food system
MarlaSpivak_2013G-0052772-0053987 after world war ii we started using pesticides on a large scale and this became necessary because of the monocultures that put out a feast for crop pests
MarlaSpivak_2013G-0069455-0070949 and what if i had to travel a long distance to get to the grocery store and i finally got my weak body out there and i consumed in my food enough of a pesticide a neurotoxin that i couldn't find my way home
MarlaSpivak_2013G-0083915-0085077 and when bees have access to good nutrition they're better able to engage their own natural defenses their healthcare that they have relied on for millions of years
MarlaSpivak_2013G-0090958-0092151 this maria spivak yeah at least in the united states an average of thirty percent of all bee hives are lost every winter about twenty years ago we were at a fifteen percent loss so
MartinHanczyc_2011S-0007103-0008320 mixing together nonliving ingredients to make new structures and that these new structures might have some of the characteristics of living systems really what i'm talking about here is trying to create a kind of artificial life
MartinHanczyc_2011S-0021748-0022639 this is how we can start to make a protocell we use this idea called self assembly what that means is i can mix some chemicals together in a test tube in my lab
MartinHanczyc_2011S-0034158-0035365 so some things that are missing is for example if you had a flow of energy through a system what we'd want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy in order to maintain itself much like living systems do
MartinHanczyc_2011S-0051103-0051401 so there's population
MartinHanczyc_2011S-0066875-0067538 so the challenge then is throw away all your pure chemicals in the lab and try to make some protocells with lifelike properties
MartinHanczyc_2011S-0078563-0080250 well they came up with three very general criteria first is and they're listed here the first is the system has to be in non equilibrium that means the system cannot be dead in a matter of fact basically what that means is you have an input of energy into the system that life can use and exploit to maintain itself
MartinJacques_2010S-0008722-0009980 first of all it's a huge developing country with a population of one point three billion people which has been growing for over thirty years at around ten percent a year
MartinJacques_2010S-0020512-0021567 this was what china looked like with the victory of the qin dynasty in two hundred and twenty one b c at the end of the warring state period the birth of modern china and you can see it against the boundaries of modern china
MartinJacques_2010S-0033424-0034489 chinese civilization you know two thousand years ago europe breakdown the fragmentation of the holy roman empire it divided and it's remained divided ever since china
MartinJacques_2010S-0049724-0050783 nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that
MartinJacques_2010S-0061988-0062592 and the second reason is because whereas in europe and north america the state
MartinJacques_2010S-0073323-0074101 in europe and apart from the mao period that has remained more or less the case ever since but this is combined with an extremely strong
MartinJacques_2010S-0087144-0088147 best and therefore we have the universal measure and secondly it's ignorant we refuse to really address the issue
MartinJacques_2010S-0097793-0098731 very rapidly in historical terms the world is being driven and shaped not by the old developed countries
MartinJacques_2010S-0111482-0112300 or take this now this is an idea but it's an idea to by tried out shortly in a suburb of beijing here you have a
MartinJacques_2010S-0125414-0126231 the little boat in front of it was the one in which eighty years later christopher columbus crossed the atlantic
MartinRees_2005G-0005313-0006594 to set our earth in a cosmic context and let me just run through a few slides this was the impact that happened last week on a comet if they'd sent a nuke it would have been rather
MartinRees_2005G-0012531-0013619 scale we see entire galaxies of stars we see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled and to the cosmologist these galaxies are just
MartinRees_2005G-0027781-0028995 and as we've learned in the last few years galaxies are held together by the gravitational pull of so called dark matter particles in huge swarms far smaller even than atomic nuclei but
MartinRees_2005G-0043018-0044206 we clearly have to be large compared to atoms to have layer upon layer of complex structure we clearly have to be small compared to stars and planets otherwise we'd be crushed by gravity and in fact we are midway
MartinRees_2005G-0055608-0056627 in our interconnected world novel technology could empower just one fanatic or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses to trigger some kind
MartinRees_2005G-0067881-0069183 he's ninety six years old and he founded the pugwash movement he persuaded einstein as his last act to sign the famous memorandum of bertrand russell and he sets an example of the concerned scientist
MartinRees_2005G-0083176-0083951 as i should have shown this earlier it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun it will be creatures as different from us as we
MartinRees_2005G-0102367-0103111 and whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into the remote future
MartinSeligman_2004-0018595-0019197 and now fourteen of the disorders are treatable two of them actually curable and the other
MartinSeligman_2004-0025375-0026542 and the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry over the last sixty years can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable
MartinSeligman_2004-0033548-0035404 positive interventions so that was not good and so that's what led people like nancy etcoff dan gilbert mike csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something i call positive psychology which has three aims the first is that psychology
MartinSeligman_2004-0049435-0050341 and it's about happiness in the first hollywood sense i'm going to talk about happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer
MartinSeligman_2004-0067713-0068218 and as i said it's not particularly malleable
MartinSeligman_2004-0082710-0083198 it's thought and feeling but what mike told you yesterday during flow
MartinSeligman_2004-0102625-0103083 who did something enormously important that changed your life
MartinSeligman_2004-0126857-0127642 we also know that technology entertainment and design can be used to relieve misery
MartinSeligman_2004-0140015-0140246 can increase positive emotion
MartinVilleneuve_2013-0018315-0019782 because this guy is the busiest man on the planet i mean his agenda is booked until two thousand and forty two and he's really hard to get and i wanted him to be in the movie to reprise his role in the movie
MartinVilleneuve_2013-0026272-0026799 six months later there was a guy on set a mime portraying the body the
MartinVilleneuve_2013-0036496-0037729 but my problem was i didn't have the money to pay for them i couldn't afford them so that's kind of a big problem too how do you get something that you can't afford
MartinVilleneuve_2013-0052845-0053460 so here i was with one of my childhood heroes drawing every single frame that's in the film
MarvinMinsky_2003-0004751-0005736 the other day i was reading something and the person said probably the largest single cause of disease is handshaking in the west
MarvinMinsky_2003-0015816-0015940 then
MarvinMinsky_2003-0028383-0029570 there are one hundred billion or one thousand billion people on earth but they're all stored on hard disks or floppies or whatever they have in the future
MarvinMinsky_2003-0042443-0043733 and nobody lives more than one hundred and twenty years for reasons that aren't very well understood but lots of people now live to ninety or one hundred unless they shake hands too much or something like that
MarvinMinsky_2003-0053666-0054504 like all this complaint about clones and yet two random people will mate and have this child and both of them have some
MarvinMinsky_2003-0065130-0066022 highly evolved sub sets of your capability emotion is not something added to thought an emotional state is what you get when you remove
MaryRoach_2009-0004885-0005399 and over here we have in the words of radiologist israel meisner the
MaryRoach_2009-0020680-0020926 no honestly when i get home i'm usually too tired
MaryRoach_2009-0036933-0037957 the semen of mature men whose semen smelled quote remarkably like that of the flowers of the spanish chestnut sometimes quite freshly floral and then again sometimes extremely pungent
MaryRoach_2009-0048527-0049107 i loved this guy i got a lot of mileage out of theodore van de velde he had this line
MaryRoach_2009-0063432-0063789 there is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom
MaryRoach_2009-0076020-0076905 why don't you just stimulate the clitoris of the pig why don't you have the farmers do that that's not one of your five steps she said i have to read you what she said because i love it she said
MaryRoach_2009-0093032-0093510 in fact he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff
MassimoBanzi_2012G-0007095-0008659 and also this is part of a large community where there are thousands of people around the world that are actually making these kinds of printers and there's a lot of innovation happening because it's all open source you don't need anybody's permission to create something great
MassimoBanzi_2012G-0019222-0019534 so let's look at what happens when you make a tool that anybody can just
MassimoBanzi_2012G-0029338-0030966 or the software is gpl so it's open source as well the documentation and the hands on teaching methodology is also open source and released as the creative commons just the name is protected so that we can make sure that we can tell people what is arduino and what isn't
MassimoBanzi_2012G-0053152-0054841 and again this is made of all different parts you can find on all the websites that sell arduino compatible parts and you assemble it into a project or this is a project from the itp part of nyu where they met with this boy who has a severe disability cannot play with the ps three so they built this device
MassimoBanzi_2012G-0081854-0082596 thank you but let's start from this example so the group of people that started this company called pebble
MathieuLehanneur_2009G-0007959-0009365 so anyway even if i do not understand science entirely for my design i essentially refer to it i'm fascinated by its ability to deeply investigate the human being its way of working its way of feeling
MathieuLehanneur_2009G-0025605-0025938 feel the affect of the white noise
MathieuLehanneur_2009G-0040246-0041186 and this kind of relationship between designer and scientist start when i was at school early in my studies i was guinea pig for pharmaceutical industry
MathieuLehanneur_2009G-0053866-0054907 so the idea of this one is to create a relationship between the patient of the treatment but a relationship of dependency but in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient
MathieuLehanneur_2009G-0068558-0069343 it would be a great honor a great compliment for me if he hadn't decided to take all them off two hour before the opening so
MathieuLehanneur_2009G-0082321-0083392 and this one is very toxic this is the reason why i created with david edward a scientist of harvard university an object able to absorb the toxic
MathieuLehanneur_2009G-0095933-0097285 local food now we can be treated by smart medicine now we can be well balanced in our biorhythm with daylight but it was important to create a perfect place so i tried to
MattCutts_2011U-0002849-0003686 the idea is actually pretty simple think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next thirty days
MattKillingsworth_2011X-0002299-0002924 aristotle called happiness the chief good the end towards which all other things aim
MattKillingsworth_2011X-0016824-0018195 the idea is that if we can watch how people's happiness goes up and down over the course of the day minute to minute in some cases and try to understand how what people are doing who they're with what they're thinking about and all the other factors that describe our day
MattKillingsworth_2011X-0032833-0033721 and finally a mind wandering question are you thinking about something other than what you're currently doing
MattKillingsworth_2011X-0050664-0051325 in other words mind wandering very likely seems to be an actual cause and not merely a consequence of unhappiness
MattMills_2012G-0016577-0017602 so what i have here is a wireless router my american colleagues have told me i've got to call it a router so that everyone here understands laughter but nonetheless here is the device
MattMills_2012G-0038916-0039508 and we've talked a little bit about the educational side on the emotional side we have people who've done things like
MattRidley_2010G-0004306-0004448 none of those things happened
MattRidley_2010G-0018869-0019804 and it's this combination this cumulative technology that intrigues me because i think it's the secret to understanding what's happening in the world
MattRidley_2010G-0031413-0032425 adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe so oz is better at both spears and axes than adam he doesn't need adam
MattRidley_2010G-0047648-0048769 they did his silly hairstyles or whatever he had four hundred and ninety eight people to prepare his dinner every night but a modern tourist going around the palace of versailles and looking at louis xiv's pictures
MattRidley_2010G-0060289-0061208 and so both sides raise each other's standards of living through the sexual division of labor when did this happen we don't know but it's possible that neanderthals didn't do this
MattRidley_2010G-0075848-0076635 an example is tasmania when the sea level rose and tasmania became an island ten thousand years ago the people on it not only experienced slower
MattRidley_2010G-0085844-0086827 because the people who assemble it don't know how to mine graphite and they don't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing and what we've done in human society through exchange and specialization is
MatthewChilds_2009U-0002633-0003919 very sure success method but really truly often you think about letting go way before your body does so hang in there and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions
MatthewChilds_2009U-0015156-0015824 climb in the needles again in california fear really sucks because what it means is you're not focusing on what you're doing
MatthewChilds_2009U-0026961-0027643 fall on to the rope or if you're climbing without a rope fall to a place where you can actually control the fall
MatthieuRicard_2004-0008903-0009094 why we have enough space in the
MatthieuRicard_2004-0017344-0017750 somehow is related to a deep profound desire for
MatthieuRicard_2004-0024551-0025319 that we don't know that is why so often although we seek happiness it seems we turn our back to it although we want to avoid suffering
MatthieuRicard_2004-0031368-0031445 uses itself
MatthieuRicard_2004-0040399-0040636 now if you look at the high sea
MatthieuRicard_2004-0054273-0054462 it's wonderful to live longer
MatthieuRicard_2004-0058600-0058726 this well being what the
MatthieuRicard_2004-0060865-0061566 they don't leave us in such a good state after we have experienced it and also they are detrimental to others happiness
MatthieuRicard_2004-0067825-0068066 and if we look from the experiential point of
MatthieuRicard_2004-0074751-0074902 mind training is based on the
MatthieuRicard_2004-0081060-0081364 with someone or obsessed with something
MatthieuRicard_2004-0088585-0088728 mind transformation that is the
MatthieuRicard_2004-0097822-0097933 this is the place where the
MatthieuRicard_2004-0104514-0104617 of the prefrontal
MatthieuRicard_2004-0111940-0112968 guy on a chair with all this kind of apparatus measuring your physiology and there's kind of a bomb that goes off it's so instinctive response that in twenty years they never saw anyone who
MatthieuRicard_2004-0115279-0115771 beings who can jump or whatever it's more to say that mind training matters
MatthieuRicard_2004-0118850-0118974 of what matters most
MaurizioSeracini_2012G-0016253-0018128 so we just said well maybe visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by leonardo since he was a great admirer of leonardo da vinci and so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap
MaurizioSeracini_2012G-0032773-0033162 named the number one artist influence at the time
MaurizioSeracini_2012G-0051239-0052351 finding i should rather say an elephant laughter because of this elephant over seventy new images came out never seen for centuries
MaxLittle_2012G-0002985-0004115 so dancing is one of the most human of activities we delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on now ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise
MaxLittle_2012G-0021050-0022472 and they're both accurate okay but in addition voice based tests are non expert that means they can be self administered they're high speed take about thirty seconds at most they're ultra low cost and we all know what happens when something becomes ultra low cost
MayElKhalil_2013G-0010706-0012185 as soon as i came out of my coma i realized that i was no longer the same runner i used to be so i decided if i couldn't run myself i wanted to make sure
MayElKhalil_2013G-0026999-0028283 once that trust was built everybody wanted to be part of the marathon to show the world the true colors of lebanon and the lebanese and their desire to live in peace
MayElKhalil_2013G-0034323-0035281 that was a turning point for the marathon where people started looking at it as a platform for peace and unity
MayElKhalil_2013G-0040921-0041654 you know the marathon has really become one of
MayElKhalil_2013G-0059321-0060110 peacemaking is not a sprint it is more of a marathon thank you
MayaBeiser_2011-0054274-0055203 the attempt to build and create a whole universe with many diverse layers all generated from a single source
MazJobrani_2010G-0011815-0012678 asking me questions he said what is your father's name i said well he's passed away but his name was khosro he goes what is your grandfather's name
MazJobrani_2010G-0022201-0022353 well then blow yourself up
MazJobrani_2010G-0030258-0030388 and furthermore
MazJobrani_2010G-0039852-0039970 you want some frozen yogurt
MazJobrani_2010G-0049154-0049177 i
MazJobrani_2012S-0015978-0016296 i went to egypt i went to say hello to this one egyptian guy
MazJobrani_2012S-0036658-0037056 the next time you're on an airplane in the u s just speak your mother tongue
MechaiViravaidya_2010X-0010632-0011114 actually below that yellow sign i wish they hadn't wiped that because there was coca cola
MechaiViravaidya_2010X-0021988-0022237 education class entertainment
MechaiViravaidya_2010X-0033507-0033702 and what happened in all this thing
MechaiViravaidya_2010X-0049488-0050451 and then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets everywhere everywhere in taxis you get condoms and also in traffic the policemen give you condoms our cops and
MechaiViravaidya_2010X-0058715-0059342 and then finally in thailand we're buddhist we don't have a god so instead we say in rubber we trust
MechaiViravaidya_2010X-0068857-0069698 access to credit must be a human right otherwise they'll never get out of poverty and then before getting a loan you must be trained here's what we call a barefoot
MechaiViravaidya_2010X-0073277-0074100 and then this is our answer to starbucks in thailand coffee and condoms see starbucks you awake we keep you awake and alive
MechaiViravaidya_2010X-0079260-0080017 if we want the mdgs to work the millennium development goals we need to add family planning to it of course child mortality first
MegJay_2013-0009986-0010197 but she might marry the next one
MegJay_2013-0027774-0028363 so your twenty s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options
MegJay_2013-0040122-0040337 and then it starts to sound like this
MegJay_2013-0055821-0056444 she was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said who's going to be there for me if i get in a car wreck
MegJay_2013-0063234-0063813 so now is the time for that cross country job that internship that startup you want to try
MegJay_2013-0074164-0075150 and i agree with you but grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with when everyone on facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress
MeganKamerick_2011X-0005386-0007258 and we're just twenty percent of the experts quoted in stories and now with today's technology it's possible to remove women from the picture completely this is a picture of president barack obama and his advisors tracking the killing of osama bin laden you can see hillary clinton on the right
MeganKamerick_2011X-0027405-0027845 she's not sure that would have happened if the editor had not been a female
MeganKamerick_2011X-0048511-0049569 this is an important point to consider because much of our foreign policy now revolves around countries where the treatment of women is an issue such as afghanistan
MelindaGates_2010X-0004053-0004546 but i also see lots of poverty and it's quite jarring
MelindaGates_2010X-0015776-0016635 i think there are really three things we can take away from coca cola they take real time data and immediately feed it back into the product
MelindaGates_2010X-0029195-0029899 and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product
MelindaGates_2010X-0042051-0042902 so what's the next step for ethiopia well they're already starting talk about this they're starting to talk about how do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas
MelindaGates_2010X-0057153-0057869 both songs have something in common that same appeal of celebration and unity
MelindaGates_2010X-0070628-0071016 they're waiting to be circumcised can you you believe that
MelindaGates_2010X-0075478-0076299 and polio i think is one of the most powerful examples we've seen a ninety nine percent reduction in polio in twenty years
MelindaGates_2010X-0082949-0083982 luckily the genetic testing proved that in fact this strand came north because had it come from the south it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission so many more people would have been affected
MelindaGates_2010X-0094388-0095653 so if coke's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness i'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms
MelissaMarshall_2012G-0012713-0012976 and when you're describing your science
MenaTrott_2006-0003749-0004705 more nerve wracking but then i started thinking about my family i started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great grandfather and i realized that
MenaTrott_2006-0015371-0016315 changing the way we read news and consume media and you know these are great examples these people are reaching thousands if not millions of readers and that's incredibly important
MenaTrott_2006-0026591-0027714 and when i started my blog it was really this one goal i wanted i realized i said you know i am not going to be famous to the world but i could be famous to people on the internet
MenaTrott_2006-0043620-0044870 personal that interests me and this is you know this is who who i am you know you see norman rockwell and you have art critics say you know norman rockwell is not art norman rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms and this is not
MenaTrott_2006-0057211-0058219 and that's where we are today it's this record of who you are your persona you have your google search where you say hey what is mena trott and then you find these things and you're happy or unhappy
MenaTrott_2006-0076257-0076947 a joke originally about my graph that i left out is that you see all this math i'm just happy i was able to add it up to one hundred because that's my skill set
MenaTrott_2006-0091913-0093009 and it was this was one of those instances where i realized how much blogging affects our relationship and flattening this sort of world that this woman is in england and she lives
MichaelAnti_2012G-0003075-0003942 china is complicated so i always want to tell the story like one hand it is that the other hand is that
MichaelAnti_2012G-0019827-0021439 in china we have five hundred million internet users that's the biggest population of netizens internet users in the whole world so even though china's is a totally censored internet but still chinese internet
MichaelAnti_2012G-0054972-0056039 so because of this the chinese really regard this microblogging as a media not only a headline to media and also
MichaelAnti_2012G-0083445-0084775 why because they have the data they have everything in their hands so they can use the one thousand nine hundred and eighty four scenario data mining of the dissident so the crackdown is very serious
MichaelAnti_2012G-0108885-0110154 so my conclusion is very simple we chinese fight for our freedom you just watch your bad cats don't let them hook up with the chinese cats
MichaelArcher_2013X-0012799-0014058 until eventually the poor old frog was at risk of bursting apart it has a little cough and a hiccup and out comes sprays of little frogs now when biologists saw this they were agog they thought this is incredible
MichaelArcher_2013X-0020059-0020898 this was very exciting but there was no reason why we should expect that this would work because this tissue had not had any antifreeze put in it
MichaelArcher_2013X-0029045-0030019 and then again and pretty soon we had early stage embryos with hundreds of cells forming those we even dna tested some of these cells
MichaelArcher_2013X-0048481-0049169 they probably competed they were eating the same kinds of foods it's even possible that aborigines were keeping some of these dingoes
MichaelArcher_2013X-0064162-0065036 and then somewhere down the line in the future we'll use this dna to bring the thylacine back the geneticists laughed but this was six years before dolly
MichaelArcher_2013X-0082283-0083992 and you've mixed them into the cell of a different kind of an animal are we going to get a frankenstein you know some kind of weird hybrid chimera and the answer is no if the only nuclear dna that goes into this hybrid cell is thylacine dna that's the only thing that can pop out the other end of the devil
MichaelArcher_2013X-0101829-0102302 and i'm positive it wouldn't we need to think about this in today's world
MichaelDickinson_2013X-0014437-0015659 you need an engine sufficient to generate the power required for flight and you need a controller and in the first human aircraft the controller was basically the brain of orville and wilbur sitting in the cockpit
MichaelDickinson_2013X-0028049-0029495 that they carry to this problem they have antennae that sense odors and detect wind detection they have a sophisticated eye which is the fastest visual system on the planet they have another set of eyes on the top of their head we have no idea what they do
MichaelDickinson_2013X-0044604-0045048 and then something happened when i started to work on flies laughter and i think
MichaelDickinson_2013X-0051484-0052539 everything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons so this is a beautiful image of a visual interneuron from a mouse that came from jeff lichtman's lab and you can see the wonderful images
MichaelDickinson_2013X-0063172-0064873 but i'm talking about the crabs actually doing the chewing crab chewing is actually really fascinating crabs have this complicated structure under their carapace called the gastric mill that grinds their food in a variety of different ways and here's an endoscopic movie of this structure
MichaelDickinson_2013X-0075003-0076266 but very very recently it's been possible to modify these sorts of behavioral arenas for physiologies so this is the preparation that one of my former post docs gaby maimon who's now at rockefeller developed
MichaelDickinson_2013X-0092740-0093348 at the same time so these basic concepts of multitasking in time
MichaelGreen_2013-0010616-0011065 down the coast here in california the redwood forest grows to forty stories tall
MichaelGreen_2013-0018648-0019430 cities are built in these two materials steel and concrete and they're great materials they're the materials of the last century
MichaelGreen_2013-0026049-0027457 that challenge means that we have to start thinking in new ways and i think wood is going to be part of that solution and i'm going to tell you the story of why as an architect wood is the only material big material that i can build with that's already grown by the power of the sun
MichaelGreen_2013-0035382-0035791 and we've been doing this new work because there are new wood products out there
MichaelGreen_2013-0049166-0049586 and when you do add the log to the fire of course it burns but it burns slowly
MichaelGreen_2013-0054461-0056064 in countries with deforestation issues we need to find a way to provide better value for the forest and actually encourage people to make money through very fast growth cycles ten twelve fifteen year old trees that make these products and allow us to build at this scale
MichaelGreen_2013-0059412-0060850 think back to that three billion people that need a new home and maybe this is a contributor to reducing we're at the beginning of a revolution i hope in the way we build because this is the first new way to build a skyscraper in probably one hundred years or more
MichaelGreen_2013-0071513-0071724 in the not so distant future
MichaelHansmeyer_2012G-0016206-0017291 or this shape so we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we're making the fold but essentially you're looking at a folded cube
MichaelHansmeyer_2012G-0031993-0033700 so let's bring this process to architecture how and at what scale i chose to design a column columns are architectural archetypes they've been used throughout history to express ideals about beauty about technology
MichaelHansmeyer_2012G-0045187-0046718 this image so to say i bought these red and blue three d glasses got up very close to the screen but still that wasn't the same as being able to walk around and touch things so there was only one possibility to bring the column out of the computer
MichaelHansmeyer_2012G-0060241-0061542 each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns you can see a different column in the mirror if there's a mirror behind the column that creates a sort of an optical illusion so where does this leave us
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X-0008048-0009975 because academia tells you after a major disaster there's typically about an eighteen month time frame to we kinda recover start the recovery process but what most people don't realize is that on average it takes forty five to sixty days or more for the infamous fema trailers to even begin to show up before that time people are left to their own devices
MichaelMcDaniel_2012X-0020355-0021599 now this fundamentally changes the way we respond to disasters because gone are the horrid conditions inside a sports arena or a gymnasium where people are crammed on these cots inside now we have instant neighborhoods
MichaelMerzenich_2004-0003263-0003395 and of course it's born stupid
MichaelMerzenich_2004-0012921-0013774 the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities and it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills this brain is very much a thinking machine
MichaelMerzenich_2004-0023909-0024361 now we study this as the nerdy laboratory university based scientists that we are
MichaelMerzenich_2004-0032061-0032327 in which it doesn't take learning per se to drive
MichaelMerzenich_2004-0040430-0041190 to be a master processor for that meaningless sound and i frustrate its ability to represent any meaningful sound as a consequence
MichaelMerzenich_2004-0049186-0050638 and it's focusing on skill after skill or ability after ability under specific attentional control it's a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior
MichaelMerzenich_2004-0062054-0062938 we look at the selectivity of responses in the cortex of the monkey we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics which represents input from the skin
MichaelMerzenich_2004-0070280-0070723 this is constructed by physical change and the level of construction that occurs
MichaelMerzenich_2004-0075324-0075504 the brain of an individual one hundred years ago
MichaelMerzenich_2004-0080227-0080637 or yourself as the actor yourself as the thinker yourself as the mover
MichaelMerzenich_2004-0088271-0089352 i'm going to talk about experiments that involve actually using this brain science first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age then by using it in a targeted approach
MichaelMerzenich_2004-0095903-0096175 we knew that they were going to be slow cognitively
MichaelMerzenich_2004-0101661-0101769 it's not japanese
MichaelMerzenich_2004-0113196-0113538 actually about fifteen thousand children are being trained as we speak
MichaelMerzenich_2004-0121447-0121608 can also take the same approach
MichaelMerzenich_2004-0131986-0132198 your issues as it relates to this science
MichaelMerzenich_2004-0137168-0137577 of course a lot of people will ignore this advice it will be a long time before they really understand
MichaelMilken_2001-0013210-0014119 sixty two million new jobs and with the concern about people being laid off today we have the world's greatest job creation machine
MichaelMilken_2001-0026076-0026951 how can that half a trillion which is a gigantic number leverage itself in a world economy that dwarfs
MichaelMilken_2001-0041417-0041964 this particular disease and we haven't reached the levels of childhood leukemia
MichaelMilken_2001-0053498-0054700 if you ever need to be uplifted join us in september october november on these tours around the country it is an uplifting feeling and a chance to meet america's heroes every day
MichaelMilken_2001-0073898-0074739 and we identified this teacher who had devoted thirty years of his life to education and he had a best friend living next door
MichaelMoschen_2002-0027406-0028689 now juggling can be a lot of fun play with skill and play with space play with rhythm and you can turn the mike on now i'm going to do a couple of pieces i do a big piece in a triangle
MichaelMoschen_2002-0061822-0062235 and change the height now skill
MichaelMoschen_2002-0076085-0077491 now what i wanted to get to is that you're all very bright very tactile i have no idea how computer oriented or three dimensionally oriented you are but let's try something ok so since you all
MichaelMoschen_2002-0083252-0083277 hands
MichaelMoschen_2002-0089075-0089291 ok now one more time and
MichaelMoschen_2002-0103107-0103728 that come from the work that i've developed ok so a moment how would you define a moment well as a juggler
MichaelMoschen_2002-0116477-0117069 yes this is the piece that i told you about it's a much bigger piece that i do exploring the space of a geometric triangle
MichaelMoschen_2002-0133255-0134191 show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways and also oh actually
MichaelMoschen_2002-0161950-0162491 which leads me to the next thing which is
MichaelMoschen_2002-0209940-0211005 well because then it tells me the truth instead of me imposing the truth and what it is is working with both positive and negative space but also with these curves
MichaelNorton_2011X-0009119-0010873 and instead of talking about how it had made them realize that money doesn't lead to happiness everyone instantly started saying you know what i would do if i won the lottery and fantasizing about what they'd do and here's just two of the ones we saw that are just really interesting to think about one person wrote in when i win i'm going to buy my own little mountain and have a little house on top
MichaelNorton_2011X-0027324-0028554 to spend on other people instead of on themselves of course these are undergraduates in canada not the world's most representative population they're also fairly wealthy and affluent and all these other sorts of things we wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world
MichaelNorton_2011X-0038858-0040124 which is really quite important so you don't have to do amazing things with your money to make yourself happy you can do small trivial things and yet still get these benefits from doing this these are only two countries we also wanted to go even broader and look at every country in the world
MichaelNorton_2011X-0053995-0055478 and i realize that you're probably thinking to yourselves this is all fine but there's a context that's incredibly important for public policy and i can't imagine it would work there and basically that if he doesn't show me that it works here i don't believe anything he said and i know what you're all thinking about are dodgeball teams
MichaelPawlyn_2010S-0010223-0012175 and given that level of investment it makes sense to use it so i'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas and let's start with radical increases in resource efficiency when we were working on the eden project we had to create a very large greenhouse in a site that was not only irregular but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried
MichaelPawlyn_2010S-0023890-0025503 so now i want to go onto talking about the linear to closed loop idea the way we tend to use resources is we extract them we turn them into short life products and then dispose of them nature works very differently in ecosystems the waste from one organism becomes the nutrient for something else in that system
MichaelPawlyn_2010S-0042671-0044407 and during the evolution of life on the earth it was the colonization of the land by plants that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy the converse is also true the more vegetation we lose the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification
MichaelPawlyn_2010S-0057301-0059215 and the combination of that and the elevated humidity had quite a dramatic effect on the local area this photograph was taken on completion day and just one year later it looked like that so it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building turning barren land back into biologically productive land and in that sense going beyond sustainable design to achieve restorative design
MichaelPawlyn_2010S-0070130-0070795 and if you think about the carbon in that that would have come out of the atmosphere into the sea and then locked away in a building product
MichaelPollan_2007-0001280-0002323 it's a simple idea about nature and i want to say a word for nature because we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days i want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals
MichaelPollan_2007-0006583-0006723 i'm a very devoted gardener
MichaelPollan_2007-0012025-0012155 both of us were
MichaelPollan_2007-0026660-0027835 lawns were nature under culture's boot that they were totalitarian landscapes and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing the species and never letting it set seed or die or have sex
MichaelPollan_2007-0039173-0039283 one hundred and fifty years ago
MichaelPollan_2007-0048234-0049154 and it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool but you know as there's a comedian who said well who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important
MichaelPollan_2007-0059057-0060151 to develop my understanding of the food system and what i learned in fact is that we are all now being manipulated by corn and the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today
MichaelPollan_2007-0069013-0070136 what else what else does he have all the six different species rabbits actually are all performing ecological services for one another such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take care of pests for one another
MichaelPollan_2007-0082316-0083047 are of course defecating madly and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field
MichaelPollan_2007-0095008-0095367 because grass is really the keystone species of such a system
MichaelPollan_2007-0103839-0104084 are something to be very hopeful about thank you very much
MichaelPritchard_2009G-0012183-0012760 face death that really stuck with me then
MichaelPritchard_2009G-0024186-0024592 have a smell of that mister cameraman
MichaelPritchard_2009G-0037363-0037396 okay
MichaelPritchard_2009G-0050682-0051250 so by thinking differently and processing water at the point of use mothers and children
MichaelSandel_2010-0007513-0008420 of moral philosophy big questions of justice but we too rarely articulate and defend
MichaelSandel_2010-0016795-0017095 or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them
MichaelSandel_2010-0024808-0025333 we have to reason about and sometimes argue about the purpose
MichaelSandel_2010-0032064-0032928 did any of you hear about him he was a very good golfer but he had a disability he had a bad leg a circulatory problem
MichaelSandel_2010-0036875-0037051 the accommodation does not
MichaelSandel_2010-0048507-0049295 who has an answer for charlie all right who has an answer for charlie what would you say the endurance element is a very important part of the game
MichaelSandel_2010-0059836-0060420 is that the discussion about the right the justice of the matter depended on
MichaelSandel_2010-0068602-0069998 it is quite impossible to say that any of a game's arbitrary rules is essential so there you have justice scalia taking on the aristotelian premise of the majority's opinion
MichaelSandel_2010-0077252-0077299 and to the
MichaelSandel_2010-0088716-0089020 only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman
MichaelSandel_2010-0098958-0099627 that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics that's a recipe for disagreement
MichaelSandel_2010-0110472-0111333 and to see whether we can partner with institutions at universities in china in india in africa around the world to try to promote
MichaelShermer_2006-0008799-0009096 and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker and then you
MichaelShermer_2006-0024546-0025360 you can say a miracle occurs it's just that it doesn't explain anything it doesn't offer anything there's nothing to test it's the end of the conversation for intelligent design
MichaelShermer_2006-0047395-0047849 this casino paid twenty eight thousand five hundred dollars on ebay for the cheese sandwich
MichaelShermer_2006-0068102-0068982 a positive nice little story about the skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization we're always looking for little good things that people do and in england
MichaelShermer_2010-0007431-0008384 for forty thousand dollars apiece it's just like this one completely worthless in which it allegedly worked by electrostatic magnetic ion attraction
MichaelShermer_2010-0024482-0024958 your next decision could be the most important one of your life well if you
MichaelShermer_2010-0040236-0041298 in other words the propensity to find these patterns goes up when there's a lack of control for example baseball players are notoriously superstitious when they're batting
MichaelShermer_2010-0057978-0058810 how accurate we are in finding patterns if it's too low you're more likely to make too many type two errors you miss the real patterns you don't want to be too skeptical if
MichaelShermer_2010-0066184-0066789 of course thanks to the environmentalist movement we're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals so what you see in this
MichaelShermer_2010-0073523-0074461 this is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle in fact it the exact same picture side by side
MichaelShermer_2010-0094747-0095455 whole other lecture but you know how we know that nine eleven was not orchestrated by the bush administration because it worked
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012-0001632-0003306 to do this tedtalk i was really chuckled because you see my father's name was ted and much of my life especially my musical life is really a talk that i'm still having with him or the part of me that he continues to be
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012-0020372-0020611 but what classical music does
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012-0034559-0034716 it was more like this
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012-0059058-0060367 the big what was to praise god and by the one thousand four hundred s music was being written that tried to mirror god's mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012-0082439-0082998 composers like beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012-0093215-0093440 to me that's the most essential of all
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012-0105793-0105992 suddenly got it and i said friend
MichaelTilsonThomas_2012-0119392-0119633 to dive in and pass it on
MichelleObama_2009P-0011528-0012114 i was raised on the south side of chicago that's the real part of chicago
MichelleObama_2009P-0021455-0022518 she's an active presence in their lives as well as mine and is instilling in them the same values that she taught me and my brother things like compassion
MichelleObama_2009P-0033919-0034897 the distance between those two ideas and sometimes we settle for the world as it is even when it doesn't reflect our values and aspirations
MichelleObama_2009P-0043846-0044805 the difference between a struggling family and a healthy one is often the presence of an empowered woman or women at the center of that family
MichelleObama_2009P-0053013-0053253 and by getting a good education
MichelleObama_2009P-0064334-0065440 and its name resolute is a reminder of the strength of character that's required not only to lead a country but to live a life of purpose as well
MickEbeling_2011A-0004959-0005707 and so we decided that we were going to sponsor tony tempt and his cause so i went and met with his brother and father and said
MickEbeling_2011A-0018116-0018432 a stephen hawking machine
MickEbeling_2011A-0039572-0039869 thing about this and this is what's completing the
MiguelNicolelis_2012P-0017784-0019367 about half a second let's see if we can read these signals extract the motor messages that are embedded in it translate it into digital commands and send it to an artificial device that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain
MiguelNicolelis_2012P-0035100-0035683 the robotic arm that you see moving here thirty days later after the first video that i showed to you
MiguelNicolelis_2012P-0054339-0056029 so when we look at the brains of these animals on the top panel you see the alignment of one hundred and twenty five cells showing what happens with the brain activity the electrical storms of this sample of neurons in the brain when the animal is using a joystick and that's a picture that every neurophysiologist knows
MiguelNicolelis_2012P-0071586-0072611 so where are we taking all this what are we going to do with all this research besides studying the properties of this dynamic universe that we have between our ears
MiguelNicolelis_2012P-0087368-0087755 i think i'm going to follow my grandmother's advice thank you
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004-0007630-0007812 religion and many other
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004-0014357-0015602 was very interesting and it actually instead of talking about little green men he talked about how the psyche of the europeans had been traumatized by the war and now they're projecting
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004-0025567-0026261 and in fact you can find that the lack of basic resources material resources
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004-0034074-0034948 this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview and it describes how he feels
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004-0043162-0043677 ordered form now this man doesn't need to go
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004-0054983-0055279 he can't feel even that he's hungry or tired
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004-0065061-0065947 the music just flows out and because all of these people i started interviewing this was an interview which is over thirty years old
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004-0074900-0076080 who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical very socially responsible you see that these people define success as
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004-0082899-0084034 and work to their heart's content i couldn't improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace now when we do studies
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004-0090195-0090971 doing for its own sake in our studies we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004-0096138-0096741 skills are higher than average and you may be doing things very differently from other people
MihalyCsikszentmihalyi_2004-0104194-0105394 the other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal relaxation is fine you still feel ok boredom begins to be very
MikeBiddle_2011G-0004019-0004317 it's my stuff if i saw it first
MikeBiddle_2011G-0014015-0015247 it's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals and the metals we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world
MikeBiddle_2011G-0030442-0030741 now while this may be the low economic cost solution
MikeBiddle_2011G-0041113-0042625 the traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals you breakdown the molecules you recombine them in very specific ways to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day we said there's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics and not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint
MikeBiddle_2011G-0052509-0054230 multi step separation process begins we grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail we use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics not only by type but by grade and out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic one type one grade
MikeMatas_2011-0003633-0003871 the book starts like this this is the cover
MikeMatas_2011-0006781-0007089 and if you want to go back and read the book again
MikeRowe_2008P-0001697-0002730 the dirty jobs crew and i were called to a little town in colorado called craig it's only a couple dozen square miles it's in the rockies and the job in question was sheep rancher
MikeRowe_2008P-0013579-0015276 lamb goes on the post she opens it up alright great albert goes in i follow albert the crew is around i always watch the process done the first time before i try it being an apprentice you know you do that albert reaches in his pocket to pull out you know this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife
MikeRowe_2008P-0023953-0024206 you know this is
MikeRowe_2008P-0037506-0037704 just bite em off
MikeRowe_2008P-0052513-0053177 oh i'm living in a computer program that's weird these discoveries that lead to sudden realizations
MikeRowe_2008P-0064615-0065389 that i've just been assuming are sacrosanct and they're not people with dirty jobs are happier than you think
MikeRowe_2008P-0079296-0080028 what if osha got it wrong i mean this is heresy what i'm about to say but what if it's really safety third
MikeRowe_2008P-0094298-0095649 on at least four fronts certainly in hollywood the way we portray working people on tv it's laughable if there's a plumber he's three hundred pounds and he's got a giant buttcrack admit it you see him all the time that's what plumbers look like
MikeRowe_2008P-0101734-0102813 but i would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time and nobody celebrates imitation the way dirty jobs guys
MikeRowe_2008P-0108041-0108835 i got a lot wrong so we're thinking by we i mean me that
MikedeGruy_2010Z-0006030-0006581 it was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand it was all i could do to hold on to this amazing creature
MikedeGruy_2010Z-0019808-0020476 this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down he reaches up takes another armful of gravel releases it
MikedeGruy_2010Z-0031564-0032388 had occurred at a pretty rapid rate on one tree between the time they named it and the time i arrived because i'm sure there are at least three trees on that island when we were there
MikedeGruy_2010Z-0047639-0048045 and it gets quiet and it starts getting really nice
MikedeGruy_2010Z-0058680-0059669 and this vent fluid is about six or seven hundred degrees fahrenheit the surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing so it immediately cools and it can no longer hold in suspension
MikedeGruy_2010Z-0075256-0076260 and this is the tropics it's raining like crazy here so this rainwater is flooding down the hillside carrying with it sediments from the construction site smothering the coral and killing it
MikedeGruy_2010Z-0087832-0088810 where alaska is instantly knowing what's going on in china and the kiwis to this and over in england they try to and everyone is talking to everyone else it's not isolated points on a map anymore it's a network
MikkoHypponen_2011G-0006186-0006595 with security and problems with privacy
MikkoHypponen_2011G-0019891-0020549 we had a very interesting discussion i asked them why i asked them how they feel about what they started
MikkoHypponen_2011G-0039656-0041408 well there's multiple different ways such as banking trojans which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking or keyloggers keyloggers silently sit on your computer hidden from view and they record everything you type
MikkoHypponen_2011X-0005118-0005297 who created that
MikkoHypponen_2011X-0017413-0018239 but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online
MikkoHypponen_2011X-0032796-0033021 as the result of a hack like this
MikkoHypponen_2011X-0051429-0051759 this is not a question between
MiltonGlaser_1998-0008691-0008943 attitude towards looking
MiltonGlaser_1998-0014405-0015551 these without comment it's just a series of variations on the head of the duke of montefeltro who's a great great figure in the renaissance and probably the basis for machiavelli's the
MiltonGlaser_1998-0019080-0019943 as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat and now four large panels this is upper left
MiltonGlaser_1998-0033954-0034854 hold alike fantastic if too new or old be not the first by whom the new are tried nor yet the last to lay the old aside i could make nothing of
MiltonGlaser_1998-0043196-0044321 very fragmentary and there wasn't a lot of information in it then i sort of got the words new and old and now i had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return i was
MiltonGlaser_1998-0051884-0052197 and one day i woke up and i said well suppose that's not true
MiltonGlaser_1998-0061941-0062685 well i think there are two fresh things here two fresh things one is the sort of
MiltonGlaser_1998-0071966-0073155 and then an experiment a little bit about the nature of perspective where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective but the shape of the bottle which is identical to the outside shape
MiltonGlaser_1998-0083128-0084108 the shadow of magritte falls across the central part of the poster a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word hat hidden in the word whatever
MinaBissell_2012G-0037933-0038503 and so we first photographed it with the electron microscope years and years ago
MirandaWang_2013-0013941-0014524 sounds cool right audience yeah jy thank you but we had a problem
MiruKim_2008P-0003554-0003951 at the same time i fell in love with new york city
MiruKim_2008P-0013712-0014576 guerrilla historians et cetera i was welcomed into this loose internet based network of people who regularly explore
MiruKim_2008P-0030452-0031306 and shimmying up and down narrow cracks and getting wet and muddy and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight
MiruKim_2008P-0046939-0047816 this is underneath my alma mater columbia university the tunnels are famous for having been used during the development of the manhattan project
MiruKim_2008P-0062744-0063411 and by the eighteenth century the caving in of some of these quarries posed safety threats so the government
MiruKim_2008P-0077457-0078404 this is a still from a film i worked on recently called blind door i've become more interested in capturing movement and
MishaGlenny_2009G-0006769-0007570 so what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross border crime well of course there is globalization technology
MishaGlenny_2009G-0016774-0017656 but there were also more unexpected people who played a critical role in what was going on in eastern europe like this character
MishaGlenny_2009G-0026900-0027392 when your state is collapsing your economy is heading south at a rate of knots
MishaGlenny_2009G-0041530-0042258 and columbia it has zones of distribution like mexico and the balkans and then of course
MishaGlenny_2009G-0056072-0057470 made the trip across the adriatic from montenegro to italy every single night and as a consequence of this trade britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue and instead
MishaGlenny_2009G-0069145-0069943 on a positive note we at last have someone in the white house who has consistently spoken out against these corrosive
MishaGlenny_2009G-0081241-0082632 even by the police's asmission this makes not a dent in the profits really of the major exporters since the beginning of globalization the global narcotics market has expanded
MishaGlenny_2009G-0099018-0099632 you would not believe how easy it is to persuade people to do things with their computers
MishaGlenny_2009G-0110398-0111364 the reason i say this is because we have to know that organized crime impacts all sorts of areas of our lives you don't have
MishaGlenny_2011G-0016797-0018722 conspiracy they say that governments are trying to take over the internet and control it and that they anonymous are the authentic voice of resistance be it against middle eastern dictatorships against global media corporations or against intelligence agencies
MishaGlenny_2011G-0028844-0030341 the hacker is absolutely central to many of the political social and economic issues affecting the net and so i thought to myself well these are the guys who i want to talk to and what do you know
MishaGlenny_2011G-0043343-0044579 this is how they were advertising themselves a decade ago on the net now carderplanet was very interesting cybercriminals would go there to buy and sell stolen credit card details
MishaGlenny_2011G-0062413-0063121 one element in a cybercriminal enterprise and often they're the most
MishaGlenny_2011G-0083014-0083561 and those financial fraudsters persuaded him to work for them on his release
MishaGlenny_2011G-0097796-0098750 who is wanted by the united states for hacking into the pentagon suffers from asperger's and a secondary condition of depression
MitchResnick_2012X-0004196-0005323 we developed it so that people could easily create their own interactive stories and games and animations and then share their creations with one another
MitchResnick_2012X-0025718-0026708 and there's no doubt that young people are very comfortable and familiar browsing and chatting and texting and gaming
MitchResnick_2012X-0042107-0043048 so of course making a fish game isn't the only thing you can do with scratch of the millions of projects on the scratch website there's everything from animated stories
MitchResnick_2012X-0054692-0056358 the same way that this uses the camera to get information into scratch you can also use the microphone here's an example of a project using the microphone so i'm going to let all of you control this game using your voices
MitchResnick_2012X-0065053-0066533 and i saw this when i was visiting one of the computer clubhouses these are after school learning centers that we helped start that help young people from low income communities learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies
MitchResnick_2012X-0092503-0093397 coding can also enable you to express your ideas and feelings in your personal life let me end with just one more example
MitchellBesser_2010G-0009124-0010555 we talk about things in relative terms and i'm going to talk about annual pregnancies and hiv positive mothers the united states a large country each year seven thousand mothers with hiv who give birth to a child
MitchellBesser_2010G-0026651-0028356 so again i look at the globe here and the disproportionate share of hiv in africa and let's look at another map and here again we see africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors that thin sliver you see here that's africa and it's the same with nurses
MitchellBesser_2010G-0040704-0041898 and so we need to do more we need to do it differently we need to do it in ways that are affordable and accessible and can be taken to scale which means it can be done everywhere
MitchellBesser_2010G-0053354-0053855 to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses as part of the health care team
MitchellBesser_2010G-0068616-0069469 but in rwanda in one country they've got a policy that a woman can't come for care unless she brings the father of the baby with her
MitchellBesser_2010G-0086434-0086929 remember the images i showed you of how few doctors and nurses there are in africa and it is
MitchellBesser_2010G-0093740-0095093 our organization works on three levels the first at the patient level mothers and babies keeping babies from getting hiv keeping mothers healthy to raise them the second communities empowering women
MitchellBesser_2010G-0102121-0103343 we're employing one thousand six hundred mentor mothers and last year they enrolled three hundred thousand hiv positive pregnant women and mothers that is twenty percent of the global
MitchellJoachim_2010-0008567-0009638 the in vitro meat habitat or homes that we're doing research on now in brooklyn where as an architecture office for the first of its kind to put in a molecular cell biology lab
MollyCrockett_2012S-0013688-0015083 when this happened a part of me thought well what's the big deal so the media oversimplified a few things but in the end it's just a news story and i think a lot of scientists have this attitude
MollyCrockett_2012S-0029873-0030241 just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain
MollyCrockett_2012S-0046902-0047982 so he's calling oxytocin the moral molecule now these studies are scientifically valid and they've been replicated but they're not the whole story
MollyCrockett_2012S-0064204-0065779 so here's where you come in if someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it don't just take them at their word ask the tough questions ask to see the evidence ask for the part of the story that's not being told
MorganSpurlock_2011-0005899-0006675 examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging that make them interesting that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and
MorganSpurlock_2011-0011750-0012087 your name here presents my ted talk
MorganSpurlock_2011-0016745-0016951 but nothing could prepare me
MorganSpurlock_2011-0033156-0033527 turns out it really means we want nothing to do with your movie
MorganSpurlock_2011-0045535-0045752 and it's also very risky
MorganSpurlock_2011-0072834-0073243 but i do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly
MorganSpurlock_2011-0094578-0095629 they enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they're using mri's to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well
MorganSpurlock_2011-0108230-0109098 today more than ever a little honesty is going to go a long way and that being said through honesty and transparency my entire talk embrace transparency
MosheSafdie_2002-0010418-0010913 in jaipur because i talked about what makes a building
MosheSafdie_2002-0026914-0027147 with a channel overlooking downtown
MosheSafdie_2002-0038646-0038776 by an arrangement of
MosheSafdie_2002-0052070-0053049 this just doesn't make any sense the pilgrims come here by the hundreds and thousands they're not going to get into trucks and buses and go down there let's get back to the
MosheSafdie_2002-0065466-0066190 so much more comprehensive in terms of information and yad vashem needs to deal with three million visitors a year at this point they said
MosheSafdie_2002-0074847-0074936 below grade
MosheSafdie_2002-0084326-0085087 the first sketch recognizes that the building is many spaces spaces where research goes on
MosheSafdie_2002-0095315-0096172 i'd like to conclude by relating all of what i've said to the term beauty and i know it is not a fashionable term these
MunirVirani_2012S-0002867-0003087 when you see a vulture like this
MunirVirani_2012S-0016291-0018147 first of all they provide vital ecological services they clean up they're our natural garbage collectors they clean up carcasses right to the bone they help to kill all the bacteria they help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals
MunirVirani_2012S-0027758-0028214 this drug has now been banned for veterinary use in india and they have taken a stand
MunirVirani_2012S-0033293-0034129 we can see that they travel different countries so if you focus on a problem locally it's not going to help you we need to work with governments in regional levels
MunirVirani_2012S-0036639-0037432 spread the word when you walk out of this room you will be informed about vultures but speak to your families to your children to your neighbors about vultures
MurrayGellMannLANGUAGE_2007-0009386-0010621 thirty five thousand years ago or earlier i can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a modern language so i would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further but that doesn't mean
MurrayGellMann_2007-0009990-0010668 experiments were all wrong and we published before knowing that because we figured it was so beautiful it's gotta be right
MurrayGellMann_2007-0021605-0022767 what i call the fundamental law we may not even be terribly far from it but even if we don't run across it in our lifetimes we can still think there is one out there and we're just trying to get closer and closer to
MurrayGellMann_2007-0031438-0031976 so what that means is that the history of the universe is not determined just by the fundamental law
MurrayGellMann_2007-0041768-0042355 newton called it that's newton by the way that one this one is albert einstein hi al
MurrayGellMann_2007-0050587-0051828 you rotate around the center of the circle the circle remains unchanged you take a sphere in three dimensions you rotate around the center of the sphere and all those rotations leave the sphere alone they are symmetries of the sphere
MurrayGellMann_2007-0063997-0064282 called by us frank yang and
MurrayGellMann_2007-0074068-0074335 the story which is not absolutely
MurrayGellMann_2007-0085859-0086133 and he could have written quite an essay on what i did over my
MurrayGellMann_2007-0092057-0092656 to know that they follow from more fundamental things plus accidents that's a general rule
MurrayGellMann_Language_2007-0005518-0005852 and i would love to see where that leads
MustafaAkyol_2011X-0013207-0013822 the very core of islam the divine core of islam that all muslims and equally myself believe
MustafaAkyol_2011X-0026137-0026882 ordains something like that but actually when you look at female circumcision you see that it has nothing to do with islam it's just a north african practice
MustafaAkyol_2011X-0042097-0043157 some muslims have been influenced by that but the secular minded people can be influenced by that maybe it's a problem of the political culture and we have to think about how to change that political culture
MustafaAkyol_2011X-0050980-0051289 these things which make islamic law
MustafaAkyol_2011X-0057945-0059934 these muslim thinkers and intellectuals and statesmen of the nineteenth century looked at europe saw these things they said why don't we have these things and they looked back at islamic tradition they saw that there are problematic aspects but they're not the core of the religion so maybe they can be re understood and the koran can be reread in the modern world
MustafaAkyol_2011X-0064066-0065449 similarly in the arab world there was what the great arab historian albert hourani defines as the liberal age he has a book arabic thought in the liberal age and the liberal age he defines as nineteenth century and early twentieth century
MustafaAkyol_2011X-0077190-0078532 and when the colonial period ended what you had in place of that was generally secular dictators which say they're a country but did not bring democracy to the country and established their own dictatorship
MustafaAkyol_2011X-0094991-0096345 for some of the islamic movements or some of the countries in the arab world you must have all seen the arab spring which began in tunis and in egypt and arab masses just revolted against their dictators
MyshkinIngawale_2012U-0012676-0014119 now anemia i'm an engineer but even i knew that anemia is something which is not supposed to be fatal it is something which probably the cure is known i mean folic acid iron tablets very cheap affordable cures exist
MyshkinIngawale_2012U-0033842-0034816 how much hemoglobin is there in the blood and this is something which is based on a principle called photoplethysmography we are actually really very excited about what else
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G-0010658-0011009 to tell the world and each other about what's going on
NadiaAlSakkaf_2011G-0043698-0044879 and the more empowered the women become the more they are able to remove the veil for example or to drive their own car or to have a job or to be able to travel so
NaifAlMutawa_2010G-0002714-0003536 will be teaming up with icons jabbar noora jami and their colleagues it's a story of intercultural intersections
NaifAlMutawa_2010G-0019698-0020522 the librarians find out and they get together a special solution a chemical solution called king's water that when mixed with ninety nine stones would be able to save all that culture and history in the books
NaifAlMutawa_2010G-0036684-0037955 dress and the last point about the ninety nine noor stones is this so the ninety nine work in teams of three why three a couple of reasons number one we have a thing within islam that you don't leave a boy and a girl alone together because the third person is temptation or the devil
NaifAlMutawa_2010G-0053099-0053783 weeks afterward i said hi hesa and he said hi i said happy new year he said thank you we had a baby i said congratulations like i care
NaifAlMutawa_2010G-0070978-0071070 what about the rest of us
NaifAlMutawa_2010G-0090564-0091307 us and this is dangerous it's dangerous when a group self identifies itself as extreme
NaifAlMutawa_2010G-0103201-0103286 true story
NaliniNadkarni_2009-0018926-0020016 passion in addition to jack and my children are the plants the so called epiphytes those plants that grow up on trees they don't have roots that go into trunks nor to the forest floor
NaliniNadkarni_2009-0032189-0033111 one of the challenges that canopy researchers are attacking today is trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequestered we know it's a lot but we do not yet know
NaliniNadkarni_2009-0037430-0038502 unable to function in the marvelous ways that it has when it is not disturbed by humans i've also looked out on urban places like this and thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives
NaliniNadkarni_2009-0046323-0047448 know they don't reach everybody and so we've been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to treetop barbie is a great example of that
NaliniNadkarni_2009-0062547-0063444 so i engaged caution this rap singer with a group of young people from inner city takoma we went out to the forest i would pick up a branch caution would rap on it
NaliniNadkarni_2009-0077057-0078157 we gave talks once a month and that actually ended up implementing some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons organic gardens worm culture recycling water catchment
NaliniNadkarni_2009-0089333-0089475 i started my career
NaliniNadkarni_2010U-0002475-0003198 but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs trees become very dynamic entities moving and growing
NaliniNadkarni_2010U-0013978-0015091 so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues i decided to ask whether the lesson i had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons
NaliniNadkarni_2010U-0028120-0029330 then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves like grief like addictions like racism that can also change thank you very
NancyEtcoff_2004-0032858-0032888 and
NancyEtcoff_2004-0062274-0062297 look
NancyLublin_2012U-0003056-0003675 texting i know i say texting and a lot of you think sexting a lot of you think about the lewd photos
NancyLublin_2012U-0018941-0019551 is the data because i'm not really comfortable just helping that girl with counseling and referrals
NancyLublin_2012U-0030873-0031097 thank you
NandanNilekani_2009-0014213-0015476 as healthcare improves as infant mortality goes down fertility rates start dropping and india is experiencing that india is going to have a lot of young people with a demographic dividend for the next thirty years
NandanNilekani_2009-0030352-0031076 and made it accessible and therefore technology has gone from being seen as something forbidding and intimidating to something
NandanNilekani_2009-0047161-0048053 among everybody including the poor to educate their children so i believe primary education is an idea which is arrived but not yet implemented similarly infrastructure
NandanNilekani_2009-0062141-0063029 that and it leads to reservations and other techniques it's also related to the way that we subsidize our people and all the left and right arguments that we have
NandanNilekani_2009-0078288-0078983 on a population of nine billion our average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year india is already at two tons per year
NandanNilekani_2009-0087003-0088037 when india was growing at about three three point five percent and the population was growing at two percent its per capita income was doubling every forty five years
NaomiKlein_2010W-0004383-0005127 the dolphins the glamorous stuff they're looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff
NaomiKlein_2010W-0016809-0017612 as the oil burst out of every attempt to contain it top hats top kills and most memorably
NaomiKlein_2010W-0028773-0029442 a great deal of time is spent in this country and around the world inside the climate debate on the question
NaomiKlein_2010W-0038089-0038620 or we ask how much hotter can we let the planet get and still survive
NaomiKlein_2010W-0050147-0050455 what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail
NaomiKlein_2010W-0058276-0058969 being told that you are gifted chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides
NaomiKlein_2010W-0070698-0071374 because this is our real master narrative however much we mess up there will always be more
NaomiKlein_2010W-0083013-0083319 this assessment unfortunately is far too optimistic
NaomiKlein_2010W-0093008-0093819 it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of england
NaomiKlein_2010W-0103381-0104072 at the very last minute we are going to get saved just like in every hollywood movie just like in the rapture
NaomiKlein_2010W-0111604-0112244 you see for some people their savior is a guy in a flowing robe for other people it's a guy with a garden hose
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P-0005069-0005951 except people come to the clinic with environmental health concerns and they walk out with prescriptions for things they can do to improve environmental health
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P-0024537-0025547 sensitive than some of our senses for sensing responding in a biologically meaningful way to that whole class of industrial contaminants
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P-0039617-0039784 so this was prozac
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P-0049783-0050779 to create an infiltration opportunity because many of you will know that the biggest pollution burden that we have on the new york new jersey harbor right now is no longer the point sources
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P-0064154-0065512 private residents everyone build one of these in a matter of months and they still remain as icons of civic response in the face of shared uncertain collective threat fallout shelter for the climate crisis i would say looks something like this
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P-0069940-0070810 this is what it would have looked like fingers crossed nyu willing and what i want to show you is actually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P-0079315-0080512 twisted personalized health but through the animals with whom we cohabit we are not alone the animals are moving in in fact urban migration now describes the movement of animals formerly known as wild
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P-0092672-0093528 and it's true the final project i'd like to show you is a new interface for fish that has just been launched it's actually officially launched next week
NatalieJeremijenko_2009P-0106581-0107319 at least as ubiquitous as that sign do not feed the animals and there's about three of them on every new york city park and yellowstone national park there's more
NatalieMacMaster_2003-0001326-0001830 just quickly start out with a little bit of music here
NatalieMacMaster_2003-0038947-0039967 i've actually known donnell for probably twelve years now and i'm going to get into a little bit of i guess how
NatalieMacMaster_2003-0063665-0064224 but anyway so then i got a phone call
NatalieMerchant_2010-0004524-0004599 suits
NatalieMerchant_2010-0024827-0025341 bringing them to light so
NatalieMerchant_2010-0039243-0039421 in the
NatalieMerchant_2010-0095268-0095650 i became very curious about the poets after spending six years with them
NatalieMerchant_2010-0116557-0116622 the
NatashaTsakos_2009-0004706-0005488 at that moment we transcend space and time together theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination
NatashaTsakos_2009-0057052-0058161 show that we're now beginning to tour and in austin texas i was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon when i arrived at one of the schools i certainly did not expect this
NatashaTsakos_2009-0077530-0078242 there is a revolution in the way that we think in the way that we share and the way that we express our stories
NateSilver_2009-0017230-0018437 black voters so you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question in louisiana about one in five white voters said yes one of the big reasons why i voted against barack obama is because
NateSilver_2009-0035622-0036356 and we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes not a lot of difference this was eight years ago some people were more republican back then but you see
NateSilver_2009-0048583-0049209 in the nineteen seventies and nineteen eighties i think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under ronald reagan
NateSilver_2009A-0005563-0007241 here and there one exception is in massachusetts that was john kerry's home state no big surprise obama couldn't do better than kerry there or in arizona which is john mccain's home obama didn't have much improvement but there is also this part of the country kind of in the middle region here this kind of arkansas tennessee
NateSilver_2009A-0021206-0022507 comparing the map to ninety six you see an overlap here this really seems to explain why barack obama did worse in this one part of the country so we have to ask why is racism predictable in some way is there something
NateSilver_2009A-0036502-0038207 and even some questions about race for example affirmative action which is kind of a political question a policy question about race if you will not much difference here affirmative action is not very popular frankly with white voters period but people with black neighbors and people with mono racial neighborhoods feel no differently about it really
NathalieMiebach_2011G-0005910-0007738 i find weather extremely fascinating weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us so i use sculpture and music to make it not just visible but also tactile and audible all of my work begins very simple i extract information from a specific environment using very low tech
NathanMyhrvold_2007-0001372-0002475 i'm in chile in the atacama desert sitting in a hotel lobby because that's the only place that i can get a wi fi connection and i have this picture up on my screen and a woman comes up behind me
NathanMyhrvold_2007-0011309-0012174 it's very hard for me to make sense of it so i'm not sure that you can it's the kind of thing that i sit up late at night thinking about sometimes often at four in the morning
NathanMyhrvold_2007-0018279-0018549 they made so far as we can tell nine hundred of them
NathanMyhrvold_2007-0028395-0029204 learn a few of the mysteries about them how long have they been standing in what positions and maybe indirectly get at some of the issues of what caused them to be the way they are
NathanMyhrvold_2007-0039480-0040372 a metamaterial is an artificial material which manipulates in this case electromagnetic radiation in a way that you couldn't otherwise
NathanMyhrvold_2007-0049024-0049891 but barbecue's interesting because it's one of these cult foods like chili or bouillabaisse various parts will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to
NathanMyhrvold_2007-0060998-0061264 risking her professional life on something
NathanMyhrvold_2007-0072529-0072606 hike around
NathanMyhrvold_2007-0081408-0081940 the study of dinosaurs may literally one day save the planet study of the ancient climate
NathanMyhrvold_2007-0090182-0090290 this would be the centerfold
NathanMyhrvold_2007-0102134-0102600 the common or lowest common denominator is me that's it thank you
NathanMyhrvold_2010-0018709-0019416 malaria is one of the great public health problems esther duflo talked a little bit about this two hundred and fifty million a year
NathanMyhrvold_2010-0025315-0026112 they don't always get to everyone and bed nets have an effect on the epidemic but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets
NathanMyhrvold_2010-0032512-0033749 in fact you may be able to do this directly without drawing any blood at all or through your nail beds because as you actually look through your fingernails you can see blood vessels and once you see blood vessels we think we can see the malaria
NathanMyhrvold_2010-0046273-0047240 and the temperature data that's very important because the humidity and precipitation tell you whether you've got standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed
NathanMyhrvold_2010-0060754-0061386 of course there's signal processing and digital cameras so what if we could put all that together
NathanMyhrvold_2010-0069126-0069241 decide thumbs up
NathanMyhrvold_2010-0082104-0082892 that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this and we're looking very hard at how to make it highly cost effective to use in places like africa and other parts of
NathanMyhrvold_2011U-0008989-0009530 and finally there's the old way of viewing food is the old way
NathanMyhrvold_2011U-0022881-0023563 and if you do lavish as much technique as possible and you try to make the highest quality hamburger it gets to be a little bit involved
NathanMyhrvold_2011U-0038825-0040206 but to make them palatable we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire and photographed it like this we've got lots of little tidbits in the book everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage right
NathanMyhrvold_2011U-0057638-0057972 and they're nice big pages too
NathanWolfe_2009-0015293-0016692 and ideally this is going to allow us to catch these things early on as they're moving over into human populations and the basic objective of this work is not to just go out once and look at these individuals but to establish thousands of individuals in these populations that we would monitor
NathanWolfe_2009-0028318-0029442 from this animal right here greater spot nosed guenon every person who has one of those filter papers has at least at a minimum been through our basic health education about the risks associated with these activities which
NathanWolfe_2009-0048051-0049277 when he began to speak they would actually recognize his voice from the radio and this was somebody who had incredible potential to spread aspects of our message whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation or health prevention
NathanWolfe_2009-0059471-0060016 and critically what happens in central africa doesn't stay in central africa
NathanWolfe_2012U-0003835-0005394 and when i was in beloit wisconsin i gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students and i'm here to tell you if there's anything more intimidating than talking here at ted it'll be trying to hold the attention of a group of a thousand twelve year olds for a forty five minute lecture
NathanWolfe_2012U-0018463-0020262 the communities of teeming microorganisms in on and around us and to document all of the genetic information in these species we can apply these techniques to things from soil to skin and everything in between in my organization we now do this on a regular basis to identify
NathanWolfe_2012U-0033329-0035112 that like beijerinck will fundamentally change the way that we think about the nature of biology that perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us or identify the source of an outbreak that we aren't familiar with or perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology i'm pleased to announce that along with
NathanWolfe_2012U-0039858-0041153 and i think if we phrase that lesson it's something like this don't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story go after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore
NathanielKahn_2002-0006327-0007269 two clips i want to show you the first one is a kind of hodgepodge its just three little moments four little moments with three of the people who are here tonight
NathanielKahn_2002-0023037-0023564 he was in rome moshe safdie he was a real nomad and you know
NathanielKahn_2002-0052692-0053522 but he was also human now his failure to satisfy the family life is an inevitable association of
Naturally7FLYBABY_2009-0015090-0015153 that
NeilBurgess_2011S-0014069-0015869 show us that the boundaries of the environment are particularly important so the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of the box that their rat's in and when you expand the box the firing location expands the one below likes to fire whenever there's a wall close by to the south
NeilBurgess_2011S-0025675-0026192 and what you see for example if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment
NeilBurgess_2011S-0035997-0037364 and as it moves around the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is so that it can use its own movements to know where it is in its environment do people have grid cells
NeilBurgess_2011S-0045840-0047839 throughout the whole brain we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks like remembering the last time you went to a wedding for example so it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery
NeilGershenfeld_2006-0009050-0009711 half as much grain is half as much useful but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than a whole baby or a whole computer
NeilGershenfeld_2006-0020535-0021638 you can compute perfectly with an imperfect device and that's when we got the internet von neumann in the fifties did the same thing for computing he showed you can have an unreliable computer but restore its state to make it perfect
NeilGershenfeld_2006-0033805-0035216 and we're doing that now over maybe nine orders of magnitude those ideas have been used to show the best fidelity and direct rate dna to make an organism in functionalizing nanoclusters with peptide tails that code for their assembly so much like the magnets but now on nanometer scales
NeilGershenfeld_2006-0056971-0058169 the students hijacked all the machines i bought to do personal fabrication today when you spend that much of your money there's a government requirement to do outreach which often means classes at a local school a website stuff that's just not that exciting
NeilGershenfeld_2006-0071607-0072360 any one thing she's doing they can do better but it's distributed over many people and many sites and they can't do in an afternoon what this little girl in rural ghana is doing
NeilGershenfeld_2006-0088313-0088865 and those have been growing up around these fab labs all around the world so this program has split into
NeilHarbisson_2012G-0012486-0013532 favorite colors and i started to dream in colors so when i started to dream in color is when i felt that the software and my brain had united because
NeilHarbisson_2012G-0028579-0028857 beauty has changed because
NeilHarbisson_2012G-0045081-0046364 so i got to a point when i was able to perceive three hundred and sixty colors just like human vision i was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel but then i just
NeilMacGregor_2011G-0004573-0006145 it doesn't i agree look very much it's about the size of a rugby ball it's made of clay and it's been fashioned into a cylinder shape covered with close writing
NeilMacGregor_2011G-0025844-0026112 and was going to bring freedom to the people
NeilMacGregor_2011G-0040060-0041952 as you all know that return from exile the second temple reshaped judaism and that change that great historic moment was made possible by cyrus the king of persia reported for us in hebrew in scripture and in babylonian in clay
NeilMacGregor_2011G-0055069-0056088 jefferson was a great admirer the ideals of cyrus obviously speaking to those eighteenth century ideals of how you create religious tolerance in a new state
NeilMacGregor_2011G-0072019-0073497 and the debate unsettles everybody in the nineteenth century to realize that the hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion and it's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of isaiah and yet
NeilMacGregor_2011G-0088219-0089788 cyrus cylinder guarantor of the shah ten years later another story iranian revolution one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine islamic revolution no more cyrus we're not interested in that history we're interested in islamic iran
NeilMacGregor_2011G-0105491-0106408 for me to take this object to iran to be allowed to take this object to iran was to be allowed to be part of an extraordinary debate
NeilPasricha_2010X-0003057-0003546 they settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of toronto and they settled into a new life
NeilPasricha_2010X-0012297-0012837 so you can't actually see them but it was breathtaking believe me
NeilPasricha_2010X-0022138-0022380 and monday morning i found out that he
NeilPasricha_2010X-0031424-0031714 and then thousands and then millions
NeilPasricha_2010X-0041844-0041931 so attitude
NeilPasricha_2010X-0051942-0052700 i love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time i love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk i love the way that
NeilPasricha_2010X-0065060-0065455 so much that after he retired from the nfl he started joining clubs and he even put out a
NeilPasricha_2010X-0079676-0080392 was olives those little white onions there was rolled up turkey cold cuts rolled up ham cold cuts rolled up roast beef cold cuts and little cubes
NeilPasricha_2010X-0090287-0091218 when i stop to think about it he's absolutely right there are so many things to be happy about we are the only species on the only life giving
NeilPasricha_2010X-0095233-0095335 we got all that
NeilPasricha_2010X-0101553-0102334 that's why i believe that if you live your life with a great attitude choosing to move forward and move on whenever life deals you a blow
NeilTurok_2008-0009996-0010042 and
NeilTurok_2008-0020801-0021776 and many experiences like this happened to me another one is that i met a miner he was home on his three month leave from the mines
NeilTurok_2008-0029055-0029658 and it contains eighteen free parameters ok which we have to fit to the data
NeilTurok_2008-0040476-0041315 the unified theories which try to explain all those eighteen free parameters in a single framework which will hopefully predict all of them
NeilTurok_2008-0052897-0054310 and in this scenario not only was the big bang not the beginning as you can see from the picture it can happen over and over again it may be that we live in an endless universe both in space and in time and there's been
NeilTurok_2008-0064889-0066211 but they're not helping africa what about africa's population the population isn't out of proportion to its area but africa leads the world in deaths from often preventable causes malnutrition
NeilTurok_2008-0073157-0073842 my parents were both elected to the first parliament alongside nelson and winnie mandela they were the only other couple
NeilTurok_2008-0082643-0082989 and put them together and just let the sparks fly
NeilTurok_2008-0091345-0091959 and that's really exciting so we designed it to have interactive teaching no droning on
NeilTurok_2008-0103033-0103775 so here is where we were after the first graduation in two thousand and four and we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green
NeilTurok_2008-0113285-0114615 another student in the first year of aims was shehu and he's shown here with his favorite high school teacher and then entering university in northern nigeria
NeilTurok_2008-0129469-0130098 the encouragement and the courage to obtain the high level skills they need to help africa
NeilTurok_2008-0139552-0140336 called for a comprehensive plan to roll out aims so we have political support right across the continent it won't be easy
NellieMcKayCLONIE_2008-0008296-0008318 and
NellieMcKayFEMINISTSIF_2008-0022161-0022314 the grey skies to
NellieMcKayTHEDOGSONG_2008-0005707-0005822 yeah i was sad as a
NellieMcKayTHEDOGSONG_2008-0015177-0015202 was
NewtonAduaka_2007G-0011317-0012540 and i will start with a brief taster of what i a ve been about a handful of films nothing much two feature films and a handful of short films so we a ll go with the first
NewtonAduaka_2007G-0031289-0031310 a
NewtonAduaka_2007G-0044060-0044753 and coming you know and his reality again this was my this was me talking about this was again the time of multiculturalism in
NewtonAduaka_2007G-0088372-0088397 she
NewtonAduaka_2007G-0093831-0093849 we
NewtonAduaka_2007G-0101740-0102834 considering where you are coming from and when we consider the extent to which it a s not taken as seriously as it should be what would you have to say about that
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007-0003283-0004162 addressing an audience like this and i don't have any smart technology for you to look at there are no slides so you'll just have to be content with me
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007-0010638-0011510 on fifteenth of september two thousand and five mister diepreye alamieyeseigha a governor of one of the oil rich states of nigeria
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007-0016860-0017709 but what happened people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007-0025391-0026164 others like mine where there has been a long history of dictatorship in nigeria the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007-0034141-0034997 an initiative now along with the world bank on asset recovery trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007-0046644-0047720 it had no business being in the state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it's inefficient and incompetent so we decided to privatize many
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007-0060163-0060422 the other thing we've also done
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007-0069824-0071251 proper management of our finances and that shores up our economy makes it stable our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007-0081407-0082831 and now we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected so huge things in construction real estate mortgage markets financial services we had eighty nine banks
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007-0092745-0092901 that things are changing
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007-0097528-0097898 this investment the best way to help africans
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007-0100646-0101468 if we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007-0110254-0110386 so that shows you that
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007-0118539-0118701 because i'm sure you will hear
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007G-0008152-0009112 about where we are now about how the continent is doing much better and the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on so i'm not going to spend too much time just to
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007G-0023495-0024852 and you know to support this i just recently one of the things i've done since leaving government is to start an opinion research organization in nigeria most of our countries don't even have any opinion research people don't have voice
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007G-0036976-0038151 you have seen here so i'm afraid you've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate we need to bring you back to say what is the combination of all these factors that is going to yield what we want
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007G-0048947-0049889 things were really bad we were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day people children were dying of kwashiorkor i'm sure some of you who are not so young
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007G-0065207-0065778 or your person involved you don't care where what it's aid you
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007G-0084346-0085281 citizens now who have a lot of money some of them in this audience with private foundations and one day these foundations have so much money they will overtake
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007G-0099489-0100155 to help them help us better and what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this ten years from now
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007G-0117615-0118649 people are afraid to take risks on the continent why can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms to enable people
NgoziOkonjoIweala_2007G-0131101-0131742 of aid government private sector and the african as an individual thank
NiallFerguson_2011G-0016869-0018055 the western empires in one thousand five hundred they were really quite tiny five percent of the world's land surface sixteen percent of its population maybe twenty percent of its income
NiallFerguson_2011G-0035313-0037029 and you see the result within an incredibly short period of time people living in the german democratic republic produced trabants the trabbi one of the world's worst ever cars while people in the west produced the mercedes benz if you still don't believe me
NiallFerguson_2011G-0056659-0057887 monolithic state covering a fifth of humanity and anyone with any ambition had to pass one standardized examination which took three days and was very difficult and involved memorizing vast numbers of characters
NiallFerguson_2011G-0068834-0069514 of a killer because it doubled and then more than doubled human life expectancy it even did that in the european empires
NiallFerguson_2011G-0074705-0075951 max weber thought that was peculiarly protestant he was wrong any culture can get the work ethic if the institutions are there to create the incentive to work we know this
NiallFerguson_2011G-0081353-0083020 you probably assume that because the iphone was designed in california but assembled in china that the west still leads in terms of technological innovation you're wrong in terms of patents there's no question that the east is ahead not only has japan been ahead for some time
NiallFerguson_2011G-0092303-0092786 that's the one that john locke systematized when he said that freedom
NiallFerguson_2011G-0105039-0106261 no we may hang on despite the huge burdens of debt that we've accumulated despite the evidence that we've lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical mojo
NicMarks_2010G-0004931-0005369 i think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times the road
NicMarks_2010G-0011183-0011303 poised to run away
NicMarks_2010G-0018889-0019279 a nation's welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income
NicMarks_2010G-0028611-0028857 and unsurprisingly people all around the world
NicMarks_2010G-0039164-0040048 and this is a measure of how much well being we get for our planetary resource use it is an efficiency measure and probably the easiest way to show you
NicMarks_2010G-0055366-0055883 programs health and education they have one of the highest literacy rates in latin america and in the world
NicMarks_2010G-0066166-0066415 we do our government policy and we live our lives
NicMarks_2010G-0076761-0077370 a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues at a personal level we need these nudges too
NicMarks_2010G-0086234-0086846 and keep is important learning throughout the whole life course older people who keep learning and are curious
NicMarks_2010G-0097222-0098075 and not only that we need to create a great transition to get there and we need to pave that great transition with good things human beings
NicholasChristakis_2010-0008757-0009546 first the widowhood effect was not restricted to husbands and wives and second it was not restricted to pairs of people
NicholasChristakis_2010-0020441-0021662 in addition some questions are immediately raised how much clustering is there is there more clustering than would be due to chance alone how big are the clusters how far do they reach and most importantly what causes the clusters
NicholasChristakis_2010-0036952-0038330 and we thought this was a very interesting comment on america and kind of self serving not my responsibility kind of phenomenon now i want to be very clear we do not think our work should or could justify prejudice against people of one or another body size at all
NicholasChristakis_2010-0046717-0048044 it moves things flow within it it has a kind of consistency people can die but it doesn't die it still persists and it has a kind of resilience that allows it to persist across time
NicholasChristakis_2010-0052113-0053099 we show them and not only do we show them but others can read them and not only can they read them but they copy them there's emotional contagion that takes place in human populations
NicholasChristakis_2010-0065074-0065838 it has patches on it happy and unhappy patches and whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch
NicholasChristakis_2010-0078822-0079613 you'd rather be d on the edge of the network and now who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip not about you was spreading through the network
NicholasChristakis_2010-0089478-0090312 and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way on the left and you get graphite which is soft and dark
NicholasChristakis_2010-0102732-0102872 now look at this
NicholasChristakis_2010S-0008613-0009669 so one of the first things we thought we would tackle would be how we go about predicting epidemics and the current state of the art in predicting an epidemic if you're the cdc or some other national body
NicholasChristakis_2010S-0020729-0022154 and the reason for this shape is that at the very beginning let's say one or two people are affected or infected by the thing and then they affect or infect two people who in turn affect four eight sixteen and so forth and you get the epidemic growth phase of the curve
NicholasChristakis_2010S-0033853-0034566 a and you have an immediate appreciation that a is going to be more likely to get the thing that's spreading and to get it sooner
NicholasChristakis_2010S-0050509-0051337 if you pick this person the only friend they have to nominate is this person who by construction must have at least two and typically more friends
NicholasChristakis_2010S-0067924-0069227 how many of their friends have the flu so bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu and if you look at this image here we are now in september the thirteenth you're going to see a few cases light up you're going to see kind of blooming of the flu in the middle here we are on october the
NicholasChristakis_2010S-0084810-0085039 and in fact we can use data from all kinds of
NicholasChristakis_2010S-0099742-0100789 and collect vast amounts of information about people's temperature but from centrally located individuals and be able on a large scale to monitor an impending epidemic with very minimal input from people
NicholasNegroponte_1984-0010272-0011019 personal computers and video text teletext systems are somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen
NicholasNegroponte_1984-0021183-0021980 input medium what are some of the other advantages well the one advantage is that you don't have to pick them up
NicholasNegroponte_1984-0032470-0033270 maybe a mouse is a new kind of bug but the bug in our case was in touch sensitive displays
NicholasNegroponte_1984-0044861-0045489 now imagine a program where some of those objects are physically heavy and some are light one is
NicholasNegroponte_1984-0051879-0052866 so it's not simply looking at the quality or if you will the luxury of that interface but it's actually looking at the idea of presenting things that previously couldn't be presented before
NicholasNegroponte_1984-0058626-0059311 show you very quickly is a new kind of book where all sorts of things live in there
NicholasNegroponte_1984-0069694-0070582 the last thing you do is repeat what you just said you try and think of a different way of saying the same thing or if you know the particular student
NicholasNegroponte_1984-0082920-0083178 page with glossary words highlighted in red
NicholasNegroponte_1984-0096409-0097158 this as an instrument where there is a complete reversal of roles the child is if you will the teacher and the machine is the student
NicholasNegroponte_1984-0111222-0111816 and they did something very intelligent they asked the child can you read
NicholasNegroponte_1984-0126206-0127066 and it's the girl on the left leaning with her chalkboard and she came within two days i want to show you the program she wrote
NicholasNegroponte_1984-0136616-0137499 we had to take a page out of the history of walt disney we actually went so far as to build crts in the shapes of the people's faces
NicholasNegroponte_1984-0150004-0150935 and start talking to that person then at the person to my right's site he'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other and then
NicholasNegroponte_2006-0006518-0006916 what the one hundred dollar laptop might be like now
NicholasNegroponte_2006-0011655-0012271 and that is that we all in this room learned how to walk how to talk not by being
NicholasNegroponte_2006-0024710-0026027 the brightest light source in the house and talk about where metaphors and reality mix this is the actual school in parallel with this seymour papert got the governor of maine
NicholasNegroponte_2006-0037377-0037919 can even have a pixel or two missing it doesn't have to be that bright and
NicholasNegroponte_2006-0049073-0050258 none of those figure into our cost because first of all we sell it at cost and the governments distribute it it gets distributed to the school system like a textbook so
NicholasNegroponte_2006-0062367-0063065 quite well the dual mode display the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors
NicholasNegroponte_2006-0074953-0075705 ok sorry i'll let jim decide which way to send it afterwards ok seven countries
NicholasNegroponte_2006-0089340-0090305 and why because there's no market for post office trucks it looks like a post office truck you can spray paint it you can do anything you want i just learned recently in south africa
NicholasNegroponte_2006-0102347-0103316 well on december twelve a company called quanta agreed to build it and since they make about one third of all the laptops on the planet today
NicholasNegroponte_2007P-0004022-0004778 and he was a clever man he sort of said well that's ok but you've done very well in your math sats in fact i'd got an eight hundred
NicholasNegroponte_2007P-0010033-0010771 i thought what a turkey this guy is and i went off to mit i studied architecture then did a second degree in architecture
NicholasNegroponte_2007P-0022011-0022823 thing moving on the assembly line because it's constant so they go around in this loop which is why you see them up there so this was great
NicholasNegroponte_2007P-0036142-0036522 being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental
NicholasNegroponte_2007P-0048432-0049667 they really work much better off board and then i could tell you lots about the laptop but i'll tell you just four things just keep in mind because there's other people including bill gates who said gee you've got a real computer that
NicholasNegroponte_2007P-0064209-0065332 we are launching with eighteen keyboards english is by far the minority latin is relatively rare too you just look at some of the languages i'm willing to suspect some of you hadn't even heard of them before
NicholasNegroponte_2007P-0079579-0080205 and boom boom boom the president of mongolia and so what happens is these things start to happen with these countries
NicholasNegroponte_2007P-0092562-0093490 the first kids got their laptops they got them by ship and i'm talking now about seven thousand eight thousand at a time went out this week they went to
NicholasNegroponte_2008-0020957-0020993 the
NickBostrom_2005G-0001372-0002297 about i've been asked to take a long view and i'm going to tell you what i think are the three
NickBostrom_2005G-0016510-0017311 we are upset about the burning of the library of alexandria it's one of the great cultural tragedies that we remember even today
NickBostrom_2005G-0033202-0033751 because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other
NickBostrom_2005G-0048632-0049263 greater subjective well being enhanced cognitive capacities more knowledge and understanding
NickBostrom_2005G-0061500-0062189 what is a technology a gadget would be the archetype and other ways of changing and rewriting human nature is quite subtle
NickBostrom_2005G-0075592-0076220 chatting with people all of these very likely are enabled by a special circuitry
NickBostrom_2005G-0090189-0091592 laser pointer a possible mode of being here would be a way of life a way of being experiencing thinking seeing interacting with the world down here in this little corner here we have
NickSears_2007-0003524-0004056 he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through
NickSears_2007-0009032-0009271 the equator's speed is actually about sixty miles per hour
NickSears_2007-0013816-0014184 a disc of light that we can control that's nothing new that's a propeller clock that's
NickVeasey_2009G-0005960-0007368 moving on to something a bit larger this is an x ray of a bus and the bus is full of people it's actually the same person it's just one skeleton and back in the sixties they used to teach student radiographers to take x rays thankfully not on you and i
NickVeasey_2009G-0022901-0023682 the door to my x ray room is made of lead and steel it weighs one thousand two hundred and fifty kilograms and the only exercise i get
NickVeasey_2009G-0049324-0050375 the bus was done with a cargo scanning x ray machine which is used on the borders between countries looking for contraband and illegal immigrants the lorry goes in front of it and it takes slices
NickVeasey_2009G-0063176-0063425 the object the more radiation it needs and the more time
NielsDiffrient_2002-0009374-0011132 everything about flying in those years which was you have to stop and think for a moment was probably the most advanced technological thing going on at the time so as a youngster i tried to get close to this
NielsDiffrient_2002-0029472-0029662 was temporarily shifted
NielsDiffrient_2002-0040786-0042313 and i chose chairs specifically because i knew something about them i'd designed a lot of chairs over the years for tractors and trucks and submarines all kinds of things
NielsDiffrient_2002-0057041-0057337 now that may not mean a lot
NielsDiffrient_2002-0070550-0071518 to your work life but i felt it was too much to ask to have to adjust each individual armrest in order to get it where you wanted
NielsDiffrient_2002-0081318-0081771 would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tailbone
NielsDiffrient_2002-0102198-0102414 or you can adjust it
NielsDiffrient_2002a-0013487-0014181 was that airplane but it built a romance even the parts of the airplane
NielsDiffrient_2002a-0026514-0027320 i had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing i'd wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class
NielsDiffrient_2002a-0038192-0038961 in an effort to rediscover my innocence i wanted to get back where the romance was
NielsDiffrient_2002a-0050679-0051916 i started with a lot of loose ideas roughly eight or nine years ago and the loose ideas had something to with what i knew happened with people in the office
NielsDiffrient_2002a-0057861-0058736 and your upper body for better breathing and better flow so that if you sit down on my chair
NielsDiffrient_2002a-0065516-0066438 come over and look at it he came over and looked at it he reached down he pulled a lever and the chair sank down she said oh it's wonderful how did you do that
NielsDiffrient_2002a-0076866-0077859 nevertheless begins to grab a little bit of aesthetic operation aesthetic performance into a product
NielsDiffrient_2002a-0091058-0092394 you have to use muscle force to hold your head there so that's where a headrest comes in now headrest is a challenge because you want it to adjust enough so that it will fit
NielsDiffrient_2002a-0101417-0101838 while you're sitting in it you can adjust it down for the five footer
NigelMarsh_2010X-0009400-0009713 and i've spent these seven years since
NigelMarsh_2010X-0020778-0021583 if you don't design your life someone else will design it for you and you may just not like their idea of balance
NigelMarsh_2010X-0029575-0029972 detailed step by step description
NigelMarsh_2010X-0043678-0043985 but being a fit ten hour a day office rat
NiloferMerchant_2013-0004794-0005254 in that way sitting has become the smoking of our generation
NiloferMerchant_2013-0015712-0016729 when they're really not that way and if we're going to solve problems and look at the world really differently whether it's in governance or business or environmental issues job creation
NinaJablonski_2009-0008833-0009542 that darwin actually spoke and wrote about humans now in his years of
NinaJablonski_2009-0022097-0023305 just how much of the northern hemisphere is in these cool gray zones this has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation
NinaJablonski_2009-0036360-0037280 this polymer is amazing because it's present in so many different organisms melanin in various forms has probably been on the earth a billion years
NinaJablonski_2009-0049605-0050537 because what happened in order to ensure health and well being these lineages of people dispersing into the northern hemisphere
NinaJablonski_2009-0062240-0062965 we have to if we're lightly pigmented be careful about the problems of skin cancer
NinaJablonski_2009-0076230-0077289 these people have a tremendous potential to tan to develop more pigment in their skin as a result of exposure to sun they also run the risk of vitamin d deficiency
NinaJablonski_2009-0083068-0083934 able to look at the evidence we have today he would understand it he would appreciate it and most of all he would teach
NinaTandon_2011U-0008244-0008526 copying nature in the lab
NinaTandon_2011U-0020970-0022428 but it's also worth noting that cells also mediate our experience of life behind every sound sight touch taste and smell is a corresponding set of cells that receive this information and interpret it for us
NinaTandon_2012G-0014193-0014477 your brain on a chip
NinaTandon_2012G-0027202-0028001 but that's not even all of it because once a drug is approved tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments this is an example
NirmalyaKumar_2012X-0005708-0006046 for support for free trade in the west
NirmalyaKumar_2012X-0018073-0018814 they said instead if you want to see real creativity go to silicon valley and look at companies like google microsoft intel
NirmalyaKumar_2012X-0041749-0043182 so he's now comparing the patents of r amp d centers in the u s with r amp d centers in india of the same company to find out what is the quality of the patents filed out of the indian centers and how do they compare with the quality of the patents filed out of the u s centers
NirmalyaKumar_2012X-0061527-0062034 out of india invented by the indian offshoring industry is what we call the global delivery model
NirmalyaKumar_2012X-0073658-0074376 you it's a self perpetuating act because of the sinking skill ladder and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that
NirmalyaKumar_2012X-0081890-0082257 so finally i want to conclude
NoahFeldman_2003-0011532-0012476 he made it very clear that he was not interested in intervening broadly in the world in fact the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world that's why we heard about the backing away from the kyoto protocol for example
NoahFeldman_2003-0023771-0024826 and the goals from the perspective of muslims are in principle peace justice and equality but on terms that correspond to traditional muslim teachings
NoahFeldman_2003-0038391-0039210 well you could fit it into a range of different interpretative frameworks you could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago which was fear
NoahFeldman_2003-0056799-0058098 who are promoting their own religious values who are elected by their own people because they were perceived as honest and sincere because of their religious values but who do not think that islam and a democratic system of governance are fundamentally incompatible
NoahFeldman_2003-0075397-0076458 now i began with the war because it's the elephant in the room and you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war if you're talking about these issues the war has tremendous risks for the model that i'm describing
NoahWilsonRich_2012X-0003843-0004948 there are many things to know and i want you to open your minds here keep them open and change your perspective about honeybees notice that this man is not getting stung
NoahWilsonRich_2012X-0017247-0018297 and in the process a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen or that male kind of sperm counterpart along the way and then travel to different flowers
NoahWilsonRich_2012X-0024159-0025169 we save on a healthier diet and we also educate and create new jobs locally we need bees for the future of our cities and urban living
NoahWilsonRich_2012X-0031202-0032370 the urban honey is delicious the bees in boston on the rooftop of the seaport hotel where we have hundreds of thousands of bees flying overheard right now that i'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by
NoahWilsonRich_2012X-0045056-0046063 and that is when the game changed for honeybees in the united states many of us will remember our childhood growing up maybe you got stung by a bee you saw bees on flowers
NoahWilsonRich_2012X-0058790-0059172 and these bees are terrific and they also will use
NoelMerz_2011X-0007909-0009015 if we were to remain sexist and that was not right but if we were going to go forward and be sexist it's actually a woman's disease so it's a woman's disease now
NoelMerz_2011X-0028762-0029624 is it because women don't look like men they don't look like that male pattern heart disease that we've spent the last fifty years
NoelMerz_2011X-0045580-0047189 doesn't completely fill with clot symptoms are subtle ekg findings are different female pattern so what do you think happens to these gals they're often not recognized sent home i'm not sure what it was might have been gas
NoelMerz_2011X-0062378-0063184 the second reason we really liked mri is that there's no radiation so unlike the cat scans x rays thalliums
NoelMerz_2011X-0073834-0075569 that's all stem cells so we hypothesized that female stem cells might be better at identifying the injury doing some cellular repair or even producing new organs which is one of the things that we're trying to do with stem cell therapy
NoelMerz_2011X-0092649-0093272 so i implore you to join the red dress campaign in this fundraising
NoreenaHertz_2010S-0008398-0010169 we face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions we talk things over with our friends we scour the internet we search through books
NoreenaHertz_2010S-0030725-0032531 and i'm saying this as an economist who over the past few years has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why but also and i'm aware of the irony here as an expert myself
NoreenaHertz_2010S-0068424-0070404 it recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first primarily on male animals and then primarily on men it seems that they've somehow
NoreenaHertz_2010S-0093530-0094463 leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company best buy was able to discover for example that
NormanFoster_2007P-0001675-0001957 as an architect you design for
NormanFoster_2007P-0009413-0009760 in some way been inspired by that agenda
NormanFoster_2007P-0015265-0015672 living acting designing investing and manufacturing green
NormanFoster_2007P-0019396-0019954 for the first time man could look back at planet earth and in a way it was
NormanFoster_2007P-0025798-0025966 it was at that time
NormanFoster_2007P-0036245-0037165 and that and more besides would be in the palm of your hand and i think that that digital revolution now is coming to the point
NormanFoster_2007P-0049890-0050721 then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings forty four percent transport thirty four percent and industry
NormanFoster_2007P-0060671-0061029 basically if you wanted to generalize you can demonstrate
NormanFoster_2007P-0070428-0071214 statistically it's the biggest booming auto market in the world and the half a billion
NormanFoster_2007P-0083139-0083972 building the roof is a very warm kind of overcoat blanket a kind of insulating garden which is also
NormanFoster_2007P-0095613-0096247 i did a sketch which we pulled out of the archive recently and i was saying and i wrote
NormanFoster_2007P-0105251-0105990 in a way the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit so it's not a kind of
NormanFoster_2007P-0114892-0115674 plus or minus very very few millimeters to be slotted together on site and then interestingly
NormanFoster_2007P-0124413-0124884 the first computer and that was at the time that we
NormanFoster_2007P-0135446-0136584 but meanwhile as you know wonderful protagonists like al gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature
NormanFoster_2007P-0144696-0146015 process that quite interestingly was developed in eastern germany at the time of its dependence on the soviet bloc so really retranslating that technology and developing something
NormanFoster_2007P-0154398-0154638 and finally you profile this
NormanFoster_2007P-0165760-0166732 oceans and seas around it so there has been a project which rescues the dead sea by creating a pipeline a pipe
NormanFoster_2007P-0177967-0178477 into the chinese society and what is interesting
NormanFoster_2007P-0186254-0187029 green ambitions and aspirations and i was voicing the thought that it just crossed my mind that new year's eve a sort of symbolic
NuclearDebate_2010-0003646-0003967 okay hands down those who are against raise your hands
NuclearDebate_2010-0011069-0011712 this is the design situation a planet that is facing climate change and is now half urban
NuclearDebate_2010-0018799-0018949 from nuclear and from coal
NuclearDebate_2010-0026089-0026251 big wind generators
NuclearDebate_2010-0036243-0037669 in terms of weapons the best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy we have been taking down the russian warheads turning it into electricity ten percent of american electricity comes from decommissioned warheads
NuclearDebate_2010-0045980-0046955 of the relative impacts of different energy sources his first time at ted possibly a disadvantage we shall see from stanford professor mark jacobson
NuclearDebate_2010-0058400-0059391 or something else so if you add these two together alone you can see a separation that nuclear puts out at least nine to seventeen times more co two equivalent emissions than wind energy
NuclearDebate_2010-0073618-0074365 with nuclear what do we have we have facilities around there you also have a buffer zone that's seventeen sq km and you have the uranium mining
NuclearDebate_2010-0088578-0089825 these diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow putting out a lot of greenhouse gases a lot of those studies will include well of course war will be inevitable and therefore we'll have cities burning and stuff like that which is kind of finessing it a little bit i think
NuclearDebate_2010-0107583-0108585 tell me they're not going to have accidents tell me that those accidents aren't going to put material into the environment that is poisonous for hundreds of thousands of years
NuclearDebate_2010-0120793-0121463 final pitch stewart sb i loved your it all balances out chart that you had there it was a sunny day and a windy night
NuclearDebate_2010-0133064-0133631 and all those against ooooh now that is
OlafurEliasson_2009-0009539-0010301 is to kind of move the border of who is the author and who is the receiver who is the consumer if you want
OlafurEliasson_2009-0030236-0031475 is an experiment i did for bmw an attempt to make a car it's made out of ice a crystaline stackable principle in the center on the top which i am trying to turn into a concert hall in iceland
OlafurEliasson_2009-0045835-0046463 i also feel that i can change the space and suddenly it makes a difference in terms of making space
OliverSacks_2009-0002652-0003383 and we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination our inscapes we've lived with them all our lives
OliverSacks_2009-0013365-0014231 a man who turns towards me and smiles but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth animals too
OliverSacks_2009-0018828-0019637 she said it's got color it's got motion but it's completely silent like a silent movie and she said that it's a rather boring movie
OliverSacks_2009-0025173-0025932 perfectly sane she had no medical problems she wasn't on any medications which could produce hallucinations but she was blind
OliverSacks_2009-0036703-0037424 the first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair it was large blue handkerchief with four orange circles
OliverSacks_2009-0047951-0048748 the things you see can be very complicated indeed with another patient of mine who had some
OliverSacks_2009-0058834-0059465 you know i was wondering about freudian determinants why kermit kermit the frog
OliverSacks_2009-0071785-0072965 so in the charles bonnet hallucinations you have all sorts of levels from the geometrical hallucinations the pink and blue squares the woman had up to
OliverSacks_2009-0082762-0083568 the deformed hallucinations there is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons
OliverSacks_2009-0095878-0096782 and suddenly that the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this but
OliverSacks_2009-0107722-0108049 and they don't disturb you because you understand what's doing it
OmarAhmad_2010U-0013049-0014212 we live in a digital world but we're fairly analog creatures letters actually work even the top dog himself takes time every day to read ten letters that are picked out by staff
OmarAhmad_2010U-0028279-0029238 this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature that you have influence in a large sphere and that my preservation depends on you
OnoraONeill_2013X-0004367-0005365 i think that the claim the aim and the task are all misconceived so what i'm going to try to tell you today is a different story
OnoraONeill_2013X-0023135-0024372 i think the polls are very bad guides to the level of trust that actually exists because they try to obliterate the good judgment that goes into placing trust
OnoraONeill_2013X-0045321-0046351 calling the task rebuilding trust i think also gets things backwards it suggests that you and i should rebuild trust
OryOkolloh_2007G-0005728-0006492 you know and this is typically what we've been talking about the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff now
OryOkolloh_2007G-0018095-0018885 thinking i mean why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school because you know as a kid you're embarrassed and
OryOkolloh_2007G-0030345-0031345 and i'm pretty much the one who figured it out because i was a nerd and i was in the states at the time and they called me he was very sick the first time he got sick
OryOkolloh_2007G-0038295-0039252 the family couldn't get cash for him to start the treatment until monday the hospital put him on a water drip for three days
OryOkolloh_2007G-0044611-0045542 i'm not unique right imagine if all you knew about william was the fact that he grew up in a poor village and you didn't know about the windmill you know
OryOkolloh_2007G-0065560-0066658 services as well as financing loan and equity i've also set up a project in kenya and what we do is we track the performance of kenyan mps my partner m who's like a tech guru
OryOkolloh_2007G-0076288-0077361 need to be happening in africa people are like ok if you don't do aid i'm a bleeding heart liberal what can i do and when i talk about my ideas they're like but it's not scalable you know give me something i can do with
OryOkolloh_2007G-0093663-0094361 whoever they want to be here without having to leave and they can have
PWSinger_2009-0009162-0010102 in technology is moore's law that you can pack in more and more computing power into those robots so flash forward around twenty five years if moore's holds true
PWSinger_2009-0020914-0021315 so the first is that the future of war even a robotics one
PWSinger_2009-0027227-0027426 and software is written in india
PWSinger_2009-0036652-0037833 the ripple effects of this are going to go out into our politics one of the people i met was a former assistant secretary of defence for ronald regan and he put it this way quote i like these systems because they save american lives
PWSinger_2009-0047435-0048511 a typical one that i was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a predator strike taking out an enemy site missile hits bodies burst into air at the explosion
PWSinger_2009-0062327-0063196 while never leaving nevada quote you're going to war for twelve hours shooting weapons at targets directing kills on enemy combatants
PWSinger_2009-0074129-0074564 and actually did turn on and fired and nine soldiers were killed
PWSinger_2009-0080495-0081430 and so we have this question to figure out how do we catch up our twentieth century laws of war that are so old right now that they could qualify for medicare
PWSinger_2009-0089732-0089908 the characters that represented the best
PaddyAshdown_2011X-0002263-0002424 in churchill's brain
PaddyAshdown_2011X-0021555-0021831 on the international stage it is not
PaddyAshdown_2011X-0035044-0035420 will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent
PaddyAshdown_2011X-0044132-0044439 and that's a big problem and we'll return to it in just a second
PaddyAshdown_2011X-0050132-0050952 you already begin to see the development of foreign policies the augmentation of military budgets occurring in the other growing powers in the world
PaddyAshdown_2011X-0062799-0064134 means shifting and changing alliances and that's the world we're coming into in which we will increasingly see that our alliances are not fixed canning the great british foreign secretary once said britain has a common interest but no common allies
PaddyAshdown_2011X-0077344-0077962 today in our modern world because of the internet because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here
PaddyAshdown_2011X-0087607-0088594 because pandemic disease is a threat to my security i have to speak to the minister of agriculture because food security is a threat to my security i have to speak to the minister of industry
PaddyAshdown_2011X-0107180-0107430 send not for whom the bell tolls
PamWarhurst_2012S-0009116-0010162 we tried to answer this simple question can you find a unifying language that cuts across age and income and culture that will help people themselves find a new way of living
PamWarhurst_2012S-0024492-0025239 they know it's time to take personal responsibility and invest in more kindness to each other and to the environment
PamWarhurst_2012S-0050453-0051996 so we thought okay what should we do i know if we can create a campaign around one product and show them there is local loyalty to that product maybe they'll change their mind and see we're serious so we launched a campaign because it just amuses me called every egg matters
PamWarhurst_2012S-0073182-0073757 if we want to inspire the farmers of tomorrow then please let us say to every school
PamelaMeyer_2011G-0004985-0005213 now speaking of trust
PamelaMeyer_2011G-0017911-0019415 or in the case of double agents and traitors like robert hanssen or aldrich ames lies can betray our country they can compromise our security they can undermine democracy they can cause the deaths of those that defend us deception is actually serious business
PamelaMeyer_2011G-0029156-0029443 if you're an average married couple
PamelaMeyer_2011G-0050466-0051524 or richard nixon's favorite in all candor he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter than knows that qualifying language as it's called qualifying language like that further discredits the subject
PamelaMeyer_2011G-0066987-0068082 look down lower their voice pause be kind of herky jerky ask a deceptive person to tell their story they're going to pepper it with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places
PamelaMeyer_2011G-0085551-0087446 they're red flags we're human beings we make deceptive flailing gestures all over the place all day long they don't mean anything in and of themselves but when you see clusters of them that's your signal look listen probe ask some hard questions get out of that very comfortable mode of knowing walk into curiosity mode ask
PamelaMeyer_2011G-0108527-0108732 explicit about our moral code
PameliaKurstin_2002-0036723-0037638 well what i'm doing is oh controlling the pitch with my left hand
PameliaKurstin_2002-0064713-0065376 think of some of the questions that are commonly asked there are so many and well i guess i could tell you a little of the history
PameliaKurstin_2002-0074789-0075528 you want to be feeling the music and then also you're trying to stay very very very still because
PankajGhemawat_2012G-0004448-0004940 is this view that national borders really don't matter
PankajGhemawat_2012G-0016417-0017707 i'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow one kind of flow of people one kind of flow of capital and of course trade in products and services
PankajGhemawat_2012G-0032526-0033995 it's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that i talk about in my book world three point zero that we're very very far from the no border effect benchmark
PankajGhemawat_2012G-0048710-0049346 and since my article was titled why the world isn't flat that wasn't too surprising
PankajGhemawat_2012G-0066468-0066894 and people ask me yeah but what about facebook
PankajGhemawat_2012G-0079179-0079896 if we already thought we were totally open to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about at this conference
PankajGhemawat_2012G-0092374-0094012 so foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up here because if you think about it what i've been talking about today is this notion very uncontroversial amongst economists that most things are very home biased
PaolaAntonelli_2007-0007056-0008229 just to give you an example this is the exhibition humble masterpieces as it was at moma in two thousand and four we were in queens we were building the big big big big building in midtown so we were in the small small small
PaolaAntonelli_2007-0021976-0023119 in italy in milan especially contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place but design oh my god what you find at the store at the corner without going to any kind of fancy store
PaolaAntonelli_2007-0037529-0038381 perplexed about the relation exactly but charles eames the first time and then charles and ray eames the second time were involved in two competitions
PaolaAntonelli_2007-0049494-0050085 the biggest synthesizers in the world what they do best is make a synthesis of human needs
PaolaAntonelli_2007-0065350-0066425 it has a loudspeaker over your heart so your heartbeat is amplified and the police is reminded it's like having a flower in front of the rifle and also you can imagine a whole
PaolaAntonelli_2007-0083366-0084683 got inspired by the poverty and smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are selling for an enormous amount of money but that's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself
PaolaAntonelli_2007-0093973-0095381 i think that this is a strange moment the rhythm of the sinosoids has changed tremendously just like the rhythm of our life in the past twenty five years so i'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is but it surely is a very important moment for design
PaolaAntonelli_2007-0101359-0102423 the container itself and instead this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved in this particular kind
PaolaAntonelli_2007-0107248-0108272 will respond to this i've sent an email already to quite a few of you but design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales and therefore really work
PaolaAntonelli_2007P-0011753-0012638 so designers work on this particular malaise that we have these kind of discomforts that we have and try to make life easier for us
PaolaAntonelli_2007P-0026264-0027049 and you know i'm showing to you different sections of the show right now just to give you a taste of it but nanophysics and nanotechnology for instance has
PaolaAntonelli_2007P-0040268-0041619 and then took the scans of the best organs and made the meat of course this is done with a japanese resin food makers but you know in the future it could be made better but that reproduces the best mri scan of the best cow he could find
PaolaAntonelli_2007P-0052486-0053350 any kind of powerpoint presentation the worst typeface it's only recently that this kind of marriage between design and science is producing some of the first
PaolaAntonelli_2007P-0070643-0071802 it takes seven days today to manufacture a chair but you know what one day it will take seven hours and then the dream is that you'll be able to from home customize your chair you know companies and designers will
PaolaAntonelli_2007P-0087483-0088193 this is quite beautiful it's dunne and raby all the robots those are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of
PaolaAntonelli_2007P-0100645-0102224 have you know gertrude's whole life and all of her files and her address book come alive and this is even better this is auger loizeau afterlife it's the idea that some people don't believe in an afterlife so to give them something tangible that shows that there is something after death
PaolaAntonelli_2013S-0008484-0008789 that design is so much more than cute chairs
PaolaAntonelli_2013S-0022793-0023286 exhibiting pac man and tetris alongside picasso and van gogh they're two floors away
PaolaAntonelli_2013S-0042754-0044191 so to get to choosing eric chahi's wonderful another world amongst others we put together a panel of experts and we worked on this acquisition and it's mostly myself and kate carmody and paul galloway we worked on it for a year and a half
PaolaAntonelli_2013S-0061650-0062582 of the bombing was actually given on eve online and after his death several parts of the universe were named after him and i was just recently at the eve online
PaolaAntonelli_2013S-0087865-0089127 the real core issue of interaction design is behavior designers that deal with interaction design behaviors that go to influence the rest of our lives they're not just limited to our interaction with the screen
PaoloCardini_2012G-0003226-0003824 let's consider for a while the option of monotasking
ParagKhanna_2009G-0006212-0007406 now here at ted we're solving some of the great riddles of science and mysteries of the universe well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved our basic political geography how do we distribute ourselves around the world
ParagKhanna_2009G-0022814-0023607 as a result in the russian far east today which is twice the size of india you have exactly six million russians
ParagKhanna_2009G-0037614-0038500 east asia today has more of those global hubs than any other region in the world tokyo seoul beijing shanghai hong kong singapore
ParagKhanna_2009G-0044687-0045551 china has signed military agreements with many countries in the region it has become the hub of diplomatic institutions such as the east asian community
ParagKhanna_2009G-0050795-0051907 well if you remember before world war ii japan had a vision for a greater japanese co prosperity sphere what's emerging today is what you might call a greater chinese
ParagKhanna_2009G-0063499-0064234 one part israel thirty years of rose garden diplomacy have not delivered us peace in this conflict what might
ParagKhanna_2009G-0076642-0077736 for a number of countries in this part of the world having pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy and for having some meaning besides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves just take azerbaijan
ParagKhanna_2009G-0093178-0093895 on average every year or two a new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the mediterranean connecting north africa to europe
ParagKhanna_2009G-0107841-0108661 what is the lesson from all of this geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline it's constantly morphing and changing the world
PatriciaBurchat_2008-0013951-0014774 so what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside
PatriciaBurchat_2008-0031857-0033024 will deflect not only the trajectory of particles but will deflect light itself so this light ray will not continue in a straight line but would rather bend and could end up going into our
PatriciaBurchat_2008-0046381-0047504 model of what happens with the gravitational lensing ok so the question is do we see this in the sky do we see arcs in the sky when we look at say a cluster of galaxies and the answer is yes
PatriciaBurchat_2008-0057753-0058569 and that is the fact that space itself is expanding so if we imagine a section of our infinite universe
PatriciaBurchat_2008-0069888-0070157 rate today than it was a few billion years ago
PatriciaBurchat_2008-0083284-0084709 so this is exactly what you want in physics where a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory that was actually developed for something else but we don't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate ok one or both
PatriciaKuhl_2010X-0003974-0005165 and what we're learning is going to shed some light on what the romantic writers and poets described as the celestial openness of the child's mind
PatriciaKuhl_2010X-0020460-0021675 two months later something incredible occurs the babies in the united states are getting a lot better babies in japan are getting a lot worse but both of those groups of babies are preparing for exactly the language that they are going to learn
PatriciaKuhl_2010X-0036248-0037238 not the american babies what we did was expose american babies during this period to mandarin it was like having mandarin relatives come and visit for a month
PatriciaKuhl_2010X-0054111-0055771 as the baby hears a word in her language the auditory areas light up and then subsequently areas surrounding it that we think are related to coherence getting the brain coordinated with its different areas and causality one brain area causing another
PatriciaRyan_2010X-0017250-0019200 from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today no longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum and no longer the sole domain of mother england it has become a bandwagon for every english speaking nation on earth
PatriciaRyan_2010X-0028214-0028376 okay
PatriciaRyan_2010X-0034846-0035553 we need more than that where do we draw the line this system equates intelligence
PatriciaRyan_2010X-0059099-0059560 people who have no light whether it's physical or metaphorical
PatrickAwuah_2007G-0013532-0014349 and so three months later just before she returned to the united states nurses in accra go on strike and her
PatrickAwuah_2007G-0025105-0025852 to join a crowd of people that were running up and down this embankment why because
PatrickAwuah_2007G-0038040-0038624 but i didn't really fully understand what had happened to me at swarthmore i had an inkling
PatrickAwuah_2007G-0047901-0048876 run by the people that i call leaders and those leaders did not emerge spontaneously somebody trained them to do the work that they do
PatrickAwuah_2007G-0062064-0063407 you know the typical graduate from a university in ghana has a stronger sense of entitlement than a sense of responsibility this is wrong so i decided to engage this particular problem
PatrickAwuah_2007G-0075205-0075500 it's such a simple statement
PatrickAwuah_2007G-0084469-0085649 ok now i just want to leave that slide up because it's important that we think about it
PatrickAwuah_2007G-0095356-0096506 you know that passion for what they're doing the persistence their ability to deal with ambiguity their ability to tackle problems that they haven't seen before
PatrickChappatte_2010G-0004514-0004809 right you've read about it already
PatrickChappatte_2010G-0015229-0015618 these last two cartoons i did them live during a conference in
PatrickChappatte_2010G-0028373-0028610 even changed our relationship to god
PatrickChappatte_2010G-0042087-0042294 this looks like a giant hamburger you don't want to be
PatrickChappatte_2010G-0050040-0050341 back in abidjan i was given a chance
PatrickChappatte_2010G-0058342-0058526 of political crisis in ivory coast
PatrickChappatte_2010G-0062896-0063185 pro government christian
PatrickChappatte_2010G-0067242-0067530 well i believe that in any context anywhere
PattieMaes_2009-0002535-0003578 to meta information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we're coming across
PattieMaes_2009-0017768-0018881 but if you want a more stylish version you could also paint your nails in different colors and the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes
PattieMaes_2009-0029781-0031200 the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you
PattieMaes_2009-0043792-0044016 current time is it's as simple as
PaulBennett_2005G-0006626-0007276 i call this first chapter for the brits in the room the blinding glimpse of the bleeding obvious often the good ideas are so
PaulBennett_2005G-0015293-0015571 the point is
PaulBennett_2005G-0025448-0026268 not particularly the world's best design solution for those of us who are real sort of hard core designers but nonetheless a fabulous empathic solution for people
PaulBennett_2005G-0036589-0036757 and from that came
PaulBennett_2005G-0048357-0049259 a tiny human gesture dictated the design of this product and i think that's really really important
PaulBennett_2005G-0067134-0067820 what came out of this this is the storage system that he designed so what is this i hear you all ask no i
PaulBennett_2005G-0082820-0083923 because again i think sort of putting our money where our mouth is here we feel that this is an important gesture so we've handed out bracelets small is the new big i hope you'll all wear them so that's it thank you
PaulBloom_2011G-0013121-0014475 there's a lot more to be said about van meegeren but i want to turn now to goering who's pictured here being interrogated at nuremberg now goering was by all accounts a terrible man even for a nazi he was a terrible man
PaulBloom_2011G-0032708-0033805 you tell them they're from mcdonald's they believe mcdonald's food is tastier and it leads them to experience it as tastier how do you get adults to really enjoy wine it's very simple
PaulBloom_2011G-0051384-0052969 the golf clubs were owned by john f kennedy and sold for three quarters of a million dollars at auction the bubble gum was chewed up by pop star britney spears and sold for several hundreds of dollars and in fact there's a thriving market in the partially eaten food of beloved people
PaulBloom_2011G-0071390-0073084 i use jackson pollock on purpose as an example because there's a young american artist who paints very much in the style of jackson pollock and her work was worth many tens of thousands of dollars in large part because she's a very young artist this is marla olmstead who did most of her work when she was three years old
PaulBloom_2011G-0077349-0078407 so he got joshua bell to take his million dollar violin down to a washington d c subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make and here's a brief clip of this
PaulBloom_2011G-0092865-0093340 the most extreme example of this is that in some cases
PaulCollier_2008-0007088-0007245 that is a human tragedy
PaulCollier_2008-0013454-0014079 the last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in the late nineteen forties
PaulCollier_2008-0020224-0020735 before the war america had been highly protectionist after the war
PaulCollier_2008-0030912-0031951 now today i'm going to take just one of those four i'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest the one that's just motherhood and apple pie
PaulCollier_2008-0039321-0040060 these new revenue flows dwarf aid just to give you one example angola alone
PaulCollier_2008-0048359-0048507 come back fifteen years later
PaulCollier_2008-0059466-0059647 so the question is are the bottom billion above
PaulCollier_2008-0065228-0065841 it turns out that electoral competition is the thing that's doing the damage with democracy whereas strong checks and balances
PaulCollier_2008-0071140-0071749 that is the very simple idea that governments should report to their citizens what revenues they have
PaulCollier_2008-0080538-0081395 worked out they were worth two billion pounds just in time a set of economists got there and said why not try an auction it'll reveal the
PaulCollier_2008-0089409-0089592 will get away with gestures
PaulCollier_2008-0098739-0099083 please become ambassadors thank you
PaulCollier_2009S-0013047-0013594 what an election produces is a winner and a loser and the loser
PaulCollier_2009S-0025226-0026020 it does increase security but it needs to be done long term it needs to be a decade long approach rather than just a couple
PaulCollier_2009S-0046433-0047405 so we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical and i want to suggest that in the typical post conflict situtation three things are critical
PaulCollier_2009S-0059574-0060574 during conflict people are doing destruction there isn't any construction going on and so the sector shrivels away and then when you try and expand it because it's shriveled away
PaulCollier_2009S-0065250-0066626 we need firms the firms have gone away so we need to encourage the growth of local firms if we do that we not only get the jobs we get the improvements in public infrastructure the restoration of public infrastructure
PaulCollier_2009S-0071669-0071772 those approaches
PaulCollier_2009S-0083672-0085020 these countries but if we put money into the core budget we know that there aren't the budget systems with integrity that mean that money will be well spent
PaulCollier_2009S-0097404-0097424 where
PaulConneally_2011X-0013122-0014329 outside haiti also things were looking different tens of thousands of so called digital volunteers were scouring the internet converting tweets that had already been converted from texts
PaulConneally_2011X-0028729-0029210 eighty three percent of them took action evidence that it is indeed empowering
PaulConneally_2011X-0040530-0042113 they're showing us what can be done with mobile digital technologies they're showing that the magic of technology can bring the invisible visible and they are giving a voice to themselves they are telling their own story bypassing the official narrative
PaulConneally_2011X-0056600-0057297 they're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers but they need to be elevated to software strategists
PaulDebevec_2009X-0008393-0008996 we basically capture enough information with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face
PaulDebevec_2009X-0020240-0021338 not only the face shape changes but all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs you can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously from stretched skin pores
PaulEwald_2007-0001592-0002608 what i'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter and actually all the way down into the sewer because i want to talk about diarrhea and in particular i want to talk about
PaulEwald_2007-0012951-0013896 to move them to another host but not always sometimes you get disease organisms that don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission and when you have that then
PaulEwald_2007-0027870-0028743 need to ask some additional questions remember the second question that i raised at the outset was how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evolve to be mild
PaulEwald_2007-0042259-0043063 other countries in which you've got a lot of water borne transmission there you expect these organisms to evolve towards a high level of harmfulness right
PaulEwald_2007-0063283-0064003 if you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in
PaulEwald_2007-0077125-0077896 and that experiment was done in northern alabama just to give you a little perspective on this i've given you a star at the intellectual center
PaulEwald_2007-0092672-0093747 so this table i've given just to emphasize that i've only talked about two examples but as i said earlier this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases and it ought to
PaulEwald_2007-0100330-0101388 but the key thing is to figure out how to lower it because if we lower it we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus and the data really do support this that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness and that will just
PaulGilding_2012-0008446-0009150 in financial terms this would be like always spending fifty percent more than you earn going further into debt every year
PaulGilding_2012-0022953-0023237 we plan to take this highly stressed economy
PaulGilding_2012-0035610-0036021 but surely we can still stop this if it's that bad we'll react
PaulGilding_2012-0049665-0050013 is how we respond to this question
PaulGilding_2012-0055998-0057015 imagine thirty percent unemployment in america as the global economy is gripped by fear and uncertainty now imagine what that means for you your family
PaulGilding_2012-0069689-0069960 you can see it at the door of your civilization
PaulGilding_2012-0083237-0083613 so named because of the level of mobilization and focus required
PaulGilding_2012-0092873-0093377 we can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society's evolution
PaulKempRobertson_2013G-0018625-0019188 precisely around trust and what people are thinking and this is a global survey so these numbers are global
PaulKempRobertson_2013G-0033442-0034970 businesses especially businesses that they believe in and trust more than governments so suddenly you start thinking well amazon potentially could push this it could become a natural extension that as well as buying stuff take it out of the kindle you could buy books music real life products
PaulKempRobertson_2013G-0049186-0050643 but only by proving that you've actually used the product to do stuff and you can't come into this this is purely for the community that are sweating using nike products you can't buy stuff with pesos this is literally a closed environment a closed auction space
PaulMacCready_1998-0001609-0002067 this is the era of environment or biology
PaulMacCready_1998-0011860-0012050 civilization's beginning the human
PaulMacCready_1998-0020347-0021499 to make it really clear i've put all four on one graph there's no need to see the little detailed words on it that first one is humans versus nature
PaulMacCready_1998-0034416-0034596 we can't go into that today because there isn't
PaulMacCready_1998-0044739-0045655 future then we did the solar car for general motors the sunracer that won the race in australia we got a lot of people thinking about electric cars what you could do with it
PaulMacCready_1998-0050351-0051057 it sends high resolution video pictures back to the operator with onboard gps it can navigate autonomously
PaulMacCready_1998-0057677-0058512 gains that can help us attain a desirable balance between technology and nature the stakes are high as we speed toward a challenging future
PaulMacCready_1998-0075051-0076290 in the video you saw that nine pound or eight pound pointer airplane surveillance drone that keenan has developed and just done a remarkable job where some have servos that have gotten down to
PaulMacCready_1998-0091196-0092097 six inches fifteen centimeters in size and matt's plane was on the cover of popular science last month
PaulMacCready_1998-0105124-0105236 read at last i put in
PaulMacCready_1998-0119997-0120170 rubber band powered
PaulMacCready_1998-0133954-0133999 for
PaulMacCready_2003-0012189-0013344 field and started a company which did more research in weather modification than anybody and there are a lot of things that
PaulMacCready_2003-0027956-0028177 and then how airplanes
PaulMacCready_2003-0041429-0041786 six years i only had to pay one third income tax
PaulMacCready_2003-0053732-0054982 a lot of good i thought back about if i was a space traveler and came and visited earth every five thousand years and for a few thousand visits i would see the same thing
PaulMacCready_2003-0067518-0068374 the humans and livestock and pets were not even one tenth of one percent and wouldn't even have been visible on such a curve now
PaulMacCready_2003-0080023-0080949 to the checks and balances inherent in nature have grown in population technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power we now wield the paintbrush
PaulMacCready_2003-0096808-0097760 as the sky gets darker and the outside air temperatures drop below minus one hundred degrees fahrenheit the most environmentally hostile segment of helios's journey
PaulMacCready_2003-0110444-0110791 two brothers helped build the gossamer condor twenty five years
PaulMacCready_2003-0123646-0123885 this was flying around in the party last night
PaulMoller_2004-0007093-0007206 they'd worn themselves out
PaulMoller_2004-0012284-0012802 the faa the controlling body above all calls it a powerlift aircraft
PaulMoller_2004-0016512-0017376 it's actually classified as a motorcycle because of the three wheels which is a great asset because it allows you theoretically to use this on the highways in most states
PaulMoller_2004-0027176-0027577 is something to replace the automobile for those fifty plus mile trips
PaulMoller_2004-0039513-0040253 i would argue actually if you look at the fact that on the highways today you're only averaging about thirty miles per hour on average according to the
PaulMoller_2004-0055847-0056848 actually the middle of two thousand and two we flew the four hundred m four hundred which was the four passenger vehicle in this case here we're flying it remotely as we always did at the beginning
PaulMoller_2004-0066883-0067338 invented the rotary engine a very unique engine it's round it's small
PaulMoller_2004-0073342-0074105 the computers back up each other there's a voting system if one computer is not agreeing with the other three it's kicked out of the system
PaulMoller_2004-0087468-0087812 this emerging technology in an aphorism
PaulNicklen_2011-0013994-0015863 bear through the forest he went through this old growth forest and sat up beside this four hundred year old culturally modified tree and went to sleep and i actually got to sleep within three feet of him just in the forest and photograph him so i'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross section of my work that i've done on the polar regions please enjoy
PaulNicklen_2011-0037718-0039485 and he was so full he was so happy and so fat eating this seal that as i approached him about twenty feet away to get this picture his only defense was to keep eating more seal and as he ate he was so full he probably had about two hundred lbs of meat in his belly and as he ate inside one side of his mouth he was regurgitating out
PaulNicklen_2011-0048784-0049808 and here we are diving in the beaufort sea the visibility's six hundred ft we're on our safety lines the ice is moving all over the place i wish i could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive but
PaulNicklen_2011-0064851-0065292 on all the copepods and amphipods alright my favorite part
PaulNicklen_2011-0084629-0085197 and i rolled over the side of the zodiac into the water and this was the first thing she did she came
PaulPholeros_2013X-0002955-0003645 use the words it all just sounds so so simple
PaulPholeros_2013X-0024090-0024695 and their health issue and it then connects them to the bits of the physical environment
PaulPholeros_2013X-0054055-0055799 i think there's an obvious question that i hope you're thinking about why do we have to do this work why are the houses in such poor condition seventy percent of the work we do is due to lack of routine maintenance the sort of things that happen in all our houses things wear out
PaulPholeros_2013X-0082610-0083587 we went in with no grand plan no grand promises of a great program just the offer to build two toilets for two families it was during the design of the first toilet
PaulPholeros_2013X-0103308-0103922 thousands of ordinary human beings doing i think extraordinary work
PaulRomer_2009G-0007381-0008527 what kinds of rules the electric company in this nation operates under a rule which says that it has to sell electricity at a very low subsidized price in fact a price that is so low it loses
PaulRomer_2009G-0014082-0014803 the real challenge then is to try to figure out how we can change rules are there some rules we can develop for changing rules
PaulRomer_2009G-0024937-0025912 when they separated they made choices that led to very divergent paths for their sets of rules so we can change we as humans can change the rules that we use
PaulRomer_2009G-0035182-0035988 the chinese were cut off from those advances income there stayed stagnant as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world
PaulRomer_2009G-0046442-0047489 zones where chinese could come and work and cities grew up very rapidly there also zones where foreign firms could come in and make things one of the zones next to hong kong
PaulRomer_2009G-0062149-0063024 the final thing we need are choices for leaders and to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders we need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations
PaulRomer_2009G-0077621-0078669 some of my citizens will move into that city as well others will hold back but this will be the gateway that will connect the modern economy and the modern world to my country
PaulRomer_2009G-0093093-0093166 it would help to have
PaulRomer_2009G-0104718-0105772 we can share ideas with other people and when they discover them they share with us it's not like scarce objects where sharing means we each get less when we share ideas we all get more
PaulRomer_2011U-0010617-0011440 later i learned that at about this same time javier and octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in honduras
PaulRomer_2011U-0026685-0028107 so i was asked by the president of honduras who said that we need to do this project this is important this could be the way forward for our country i was asked to come to tegucigalpa and talk again on january fourth and fifth
PaulRomer_2011U-0044382-0045097 the other place that's very interested in city building is singapore they've actually built two cities already in china and are preparing the third
PaulRothemund_2007-0006056-0006825 so now the thing is that this is a different kind of spell this is a computer program made of zeros and ones it can be pronounced on a computer it does something like this
PaulRothemund_2007-0023263-0024520 you can look with a microscope and see them on a surface and the neat thing is that if you change the sequence and change the spell you just change the sequence of the staples you can make a molecule that looks like this and you know he likes to hang out with his
PaulRothemund_2008-0012126-0012919 so my friends molecular programmers and i have a sort of bio molecule centric approach we're interested in using dna rna and protein and building new
PaulRothemund_2008-0028610-0029751 and i'm going to draw it like this sometimes just so i don't scare you we want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix when we synthesize it it comes single stranded so we can take the blue strand in one
PaulRothemund_2008-0044549-0045282 and i got fifty billion little smiley faces floating around in a single drop of water and each one of these is just one
PaulRothemund_2008-0051983-0052795 so this works really well and you can make patterns as well as shapes ok and you can make a map of the americas and spell dna with dna and
PaulRothemund_2008-0060026-0060900 so now you can say all right why isn't dna origami the end of the story you have your molecular compiler you can do whatever you want the fact is that it does not scale so
PaulRothemund_2008-0070056-0070999 it knows when to stop growing because it can count it knows how big it is so that answers that sort of first question i was talking about it doesn't tell us how babies do it however
PaulRothemund_2008-0085690-0086539 address this memory so you can actually make a complicated circuit using a little bit of computation it's a molecular computer building an electronic computer now you ask me
PaulSereno_2005-0004018-0005313 mammals radiated out to take their place and so we know this in extraordinary detail and so this is a core from near bermuda we know that the tsunamis the earthquakes and the things that we've experienced in the entire record of humankind history
PaulSereno_2005-0017765-0018891 the time it took to reach maximum body size yes they do have larger body size but many of them are smaller but we're interested in the time it took them to achieve that fifty million years to achieve this maximum body size
PaulSereno_2005-0030945-0032083 at the bottom of the cliff we find that they're rare as hens teeth that's where dinosaur origins is to be found at the bottom of the cliff you go into an area like this you get a geologic map you get a topographic map and the best most inspired team
PaulSereno_2005-0046723-0047667 people who understand science as adventure with a purpose they're usually students who've never seen a desert some of them are more experienced your job as a leader this is definitely a team sport
PaulSereno_2005-0061226-0062169 this is something we found in morocco an immense animal we prototyped by cat scanning the brain out of this animal it turns out to have a forebrain one fifteenth the size of a human
PaulSereno_2005-0075826-0076054 a fourteen foot croc
PaulSereno_2005-0091351-0092130 you're living peacefully on each side and on one side you just go extinct and you survive on the other side and create a difference and the fourth thing is that
PaulSereno_2005-0104666-0105869 nearly killed me i found myself in art i was a total failure in school not really headed to graduate high school and i went on that's my first painting on canvas i read a dictionary i got into college i became an artist ok and started drawing
PaulSereno_2005-0120625-0121789 and we created a track record because when you go out there as a scholar and you try to find out longitudinal studies track records like that there essentially are very few if none so we've created an incredible track record of one hundred percent graduation
PaulSnelgrove_2011G-0013938-0015188 and so what did we find we found spectacular new species the most beautiful and visually stunning things everywhere we looked from the shoreline to the abyss form microbes all the way up to fish and everything in between
PaulSnelgrove_2011G-0028358-0030143 now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one it's from trophy fish caught off the coast of florida and so this is a photograph from the one thousand nine hundred and fifty s i want you to notice the scale on the slide because when you see the same picture from the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s we see the fish are much smaller and we're also seeing a change in terms of the composition of those fish
PaulSnelgrove_2011G-0043612-0044459 and so from this we're able to identify these blue highways these hot spots in the ocean that should be real priority areas for ocean conservation
PaulSnelgrove_2011G-0059650-0060062 and what we find if we plot up the well known species is this sort of a distribution
PaulSnelgrove_2011G-0066552-0066916 but there's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things
PaulSnelgrove_2011G-0074105-0075351 if you were to suck all the water out of the ocean this is what you'd be left behind with and that's the biomass of life on the sea floor now what we see is huge biomass towards the poles and not much biomass in between
PaulSnelgrove_2011G-0087928-0089662 the most exciting thing i would say about this census is the role of global science and so as we see in this image of light during the night there are lots of areas of the earth where human development is much greater and other areas where it's much less but between them we see large dark areas of relatively unexplored ocean
PaulStamets_2008-0003346-0004047 every organism had a right to vote would we be voted on the planet or off the planet i think that vote is occurring right now
PaulStamets_2008-0016316-0017599 and the spores are germinating and the mycelium forms and goes underground in a single cubic inch of soil there can be more than eight miles of these cells my foot is covering approximately three hundred miles of mycelium
PaulStamets_2008-0031377-0031945 most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land they came to land one point three billion years ago
PaulStamets_2008-0039885-0040033 were dotted these giant mushrooms
PaulStamets_2008-0046802-0047636 can be so large and yet be one cell wall thick whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us the mycelium in the right conditions produces a mushroom
PaulStamets_2008-0062997-0064417 so this one mushroom in particular has drawn our interest over time this is my wife dusty with a mushroom called fomitopsis officinalis agaricon it's a mushroom exclusive to the old growth forest that dioscorides first described in sixty five a d as a treatment against consumption
PaulStamets_2008-0082719-0083563 the ants were attracted to the mycelium because there's no spores they gave it to the queen one week later i had no sawdust piles whatsoever
PaulStamets_2008-0092916-0093827 from a cardboard box i want to re invent the delivery system and the use of cardboard around the world so they become ecological footprints if there's a youtube like
PaulWolpe_2010X-0001574-0003377 design but not design as we usually think about it i want to talk about what is happening now in our scientific biotechnological culture where for really the first time in history we have the power to design bodies to design animal bodies to design human
PaulWolpe_2010X-0012494-0014216 forms that inhabit our planet so i want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species as well as our cultures because of this change now we actually have been doing it for a long time
PaulWolpe_2010X-0027114-0028123 these are normal mammalian cells genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene taken out of deep sea jellyfish we all know that some
PaulWolpe_2010X-0038981-0039289 to ban
PaulWolpe_2010X-0053517-0054534 drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create so with antithrombin in that goat that goat has been genetically modified so that the molecules of its milk
PaulWolpe_2010X-0066762-0067034 electrodes in its ganglia and its brain
PaulWolpe_2010X-0076076-0077627 it's not just insects this is the ratbot or the robo rat by sanjiv talwar at suny downstate again it's got technology it's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres it's got a camera on top of its head the scientists can make this
PaulWolpe_2010X-0083161-0084366 monitor in the monkey's cage that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm and the monkey got fascinated the monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm this prosthetic arm would do and eventually she was moving
PaulWolpe_2010X-0099481-0099748 this is where we are in this process
PaulWolpe_2010X-0114519-0115322 we are now taking control of our own evolution we are directly designing the future of the species of this planet
PaulZak_2011G-0012827-0013716 it is he said only a female molecule it can't be that important but i countered well men's brains make this too there must be a reason why
PaulZak_2011G-0026119-0026270 in the other person's account
PaulZak_2011G-0040239-0040458 but is it the moral molecule
PaulZak_2011G-0052492-0052967 because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off
PaulZak_2011G-0075384-0076604 two hundred people in this beautiful victorian mansion i didn't know a single person and i drove up in my rented vauxhall and i took out a centrifuge and dry ice and needles and tubes and i took
PaulZak_2011G-0093966-0094304 so my penchant for hugging other people has earned me the nickname dr love
PaulaScher_2008P-0011998-0012981 poker is serious washington d c is solemn new york is serious going to educational conferences to tell you anything about the future
PaulaScher_2008P-0024899-0025802 i find it's actually getting really hard to be serious i'm hired to be solemn but i find more and more that i'm solemn when i don't have to be
PaulaScher_2008P-0041817-0042760 and then accomplish things by the end of the seventies actually the stuff became known i mean these covers appeared all over the world and they started winning awards and
PaulaScher_2008P-0055264-0056655 and i began getting immersed in this project in a way i never was before this is what theater advertising looked like at that time this is what was in the newspapers and in the new york times so this is sort of a comment on the time
PaulaScher_2008P-0068147-0068917 because people began to copy it here's an ad in the new york times somebody did for a play called mind games
PaulaScher_2008P-0078818-0079634 but i fell in love with this process of actually integrating graphics into architecture because i didn't know what i was
PaulaScher_2008P-0093787-0094488 but it became the end of the seriousness of the play and it started to once again become solemn
PaulaScher_2008P-0100335-0101116 but i was so utterly unqualified for this project and so utterly ridiculous and ignored the brief
PaulaScher_2008P-0105836-0106340 and then i spent a year going to long
PaulaScher_2008P-0120936-0121677 one from the series this is a print from the united states which we did in red white and blue we began doing these big silkscreen prints
PavanSukhdev_2011G-0008234-0009605 and doing for nature what lord stern and his team did for nature is not that easy and yet we began we began the project with an interim report which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been collected on the subject
PavanSukhdev_2011G-0022266-0023832 it's not just about the amazonas or indeed about rainforests no matter what level you look at whether it's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level we see the same problem again and again so rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests at an ecosystem level
PavanSukhdev_2011G-0041505-0041957 europe sub saharan africa as we move on and consume
PavanSukhdev_2011G-0055185-0055863 business as usual which causes climate changing emissions which have an economic cost it causes pollutants being issued which have an economic cost
PavanSukhdev_2011G-0073500-0074405 well i think we kind of did it at the same time but he's done it he's basically worked the cost to puma puma has two point seven billion dollars of turnover three hundred million dollars of profits
PavanSukhdev_2011G-0093663-0095477 five hundred million people who live in the developing world in poor countries so in selecting targets of four hundred and fifty parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations what we have done is we've made an ethical choice we've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not have coral reefs
PawanSinha_2009I-0011694-0012594 that's my son darius as a new father i have a qualitatively different sense of just how delicate
PawanSinha_2009I-0026220-0026997 the prakash the overall effort has three components outreach to identify children in need of care
PawanSinha_2009I-0044536-0045246 a tragic postscript to this she died two years ago in a bus accident so
PawanSinha_2009I-0056075-0057078 putting together integrating subsets of these regions into something that's more meaningful into what we would consider to be objects as you see on the right
PawanSinha_2009I-0074746-0075535 this simple idea has far reaching implications and let me just quickly mention two one drawing from the domain of engineering
PawanSinha_2009I-0087242-0088186 they are looking at the world in a very very blurry fashion here's what a babycam video looks like
PawanSinha_2009I-0100396-0101076 the efficiency of the use of dynamic information seems to be significantly compromised in autism
PearlArredondo_2013S-0009051-0009675 i needed teachers in the classroom every day who were going to say you can move beyond that
PearlArredondo_2013S-0020948-0021426 i had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before
PearlArredondo_2013S-0027088-0027445 attached to our school district for funding for support
PearlArredondo_2013S-0037178-0038985 and they use all the technology that they're used to laptops computers tablets you name it they have it animation software moviemaking software they have it all and because we connect it to what they're doing for example they made public service announcements for the cancer society
PenelopeBoston_2006-0002705-0003356 until about a dozen years ago when i was really captured by caves and i really re focused most of my research in that direction
PenelopeBoston_2006-0015625-0016729 no life and so life is more valuable than no life and so i think that that holds together a great deal of the work that people in this audience approach
PenelopeBoston_2006-0030013-0031170 planets outside of our solar system being confirmed and just last month a couple of weeks ago a planet in the size class of earth has actually been found and so this is very exciting news
PenelopeBoston_2006-0046126-0047021 it's probably hiding because if you are out sequestering resources from your environment that makes you yummy and other things might want to eat you or consume you and so
PenelopeBoston_2006-0062623-0063342 so this is part of the ability that we have to try to stretch our imagination in terms of what we may find in the future
PenelopeBoston_2006-0081052-0082304 lava tube caves i've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet we know that on mars and the moon there are tons of these structures we can see them on the left you can see a lava tube forming at a recent eruption
PenelopeBoston_2006-0097089-0098164 now to wrap this up i want to talk for two seconds about caves and the human expansion beyond earth as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves it occurred to us a number of years ago that
PeteAlcorn_2009-0007511-0007854 make investing in property a bad bet
PeteAlcorn_2009-0017644-0019134 so why does this matter why talk about social economic movements that may be more than a century away because transitions are dangerous times when land owners start to lose money and labor demands more pay
PeterAttia_2013P-0015699-0017329 ironically at that time in my life i was also doing cancer research immune based therapies for melanoma to be specific and in that world i was actually taught to question everything to challenge all assumptions and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards
PeterAttia_2013P-0028916-0029647 if the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me was it possible it was failing someone else
PeterAttia_2013P-0041648-0043038 consider the following analogy think of the bruise you get on your shin when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table sure the bruise hurts like hell and you almost certainly don't like the discolored look
PeterAttia_2013P-0057688-0058990 what if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity are just wrong personally i can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore let alone the luxury of certainty
PeterAttia_2013P-0068915-0069775 for the past year i've been fortunate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country
PeterAttia_2013P-0078530-0079804 and finally once we identify what safe and practical changes people can make to their diet how can we move their behavior in that direction so that it becomes more the default rather
PeterAttia_2013P-0086799-0088340 staying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science if obesity is nothing more than a proxy for metabolic illness what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy
PeterDiamandis_2005G-0016344-0017129 this was my motivation was actually during apollo and apollo was one of the greatest motivators ever if you think about what happened
PeterDiamandis_2005G-0028536-0029581 and clearly the cost to orbit is key once you're in orbit you are two thirds of the way energetically to anywhere the moon to mars and today there's only three vehicles the u s shuttle
PeterDiamandis_2005G-0040713-0041786 the difficulty is that there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment today the boeings and the lockheeds don't spend a dollar of their own money in r d
PeterDiamandis_2005G-0061503-0062663 so a little bit about the future steps to space what's available for you today you can go and experience weightless flights by eight suborbital flights the price tag for that
PeterDiamandis_2005G-0078652-0079776 if you were going to go and try to create spaceshipone or any kind of a new technology you have to fund that from the beginning and maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome it may or may not happen
PeterDiamandis_2008-0006145-0007366 you take an airplane you fly over the top you're weightless for twenty five seconds come back down you weigh twice as much you do it again and again you can get eight ten minutes weightlessness how nasa's trained their astronauts for so long
PeterDiamandis_2008-0017929-0018988 and after that first parabola you know the doc said everything is great he was smiling and we said go so we did a second parabola
PeterDiamandis_2012-0012849-0013458 to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance
PeterDiamandis_2012-0020224-0021291 and we keep setting our expectations higher and higher in fact we redefine what poverty means think of this in america today the majority of people under the poverty line
PeterDiamandis_2012-0028023-0028898 it doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges and also even though it's plotted on a log curve on the left it's curving upwards
PeterDiamandis_2012-0038863-0039366 when i think about creating abundance
PeterDiamandis_2012-0046472-0046700 and literally made aluminum so cheap
PeterDiamandis_2012-0053474-0053983 do you remember when carl sagan turned the voyager spacecraft
PeterDiamandis_2012-0067667-0068025 probably the best part of it is what's coming down the pike in health
PeterDiamandis_2012-0078815-0080165 and they will get healthier by using the tricorder and they'll become better educated by using the khan academy and by literally being able to use three d printing and infinite computing become more productive than ever before
PeterDiamandis_2012-0083315-0084640 driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past let me share and close with a story that really got me excited
PeterDiamandis_2012-0087861-0089404 hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it and it showed that in fact today the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world
PeterDonnelly_2005G-0006317-0007567 and there's another in joke among statisticians and that's how do you tell the introverted statistician from the extroverted statistician to which the answer is the extroverted statistician's the one who looks at the other person's shoes
PeterDonnelly_2005G-0021059-0021876 how we react to that and how well we do or don't think about it so you've had a pretty easy time up till now a few laughs and all that kind of thing in the talks
PeterDonnelly_2005G-0035855-0036709 a is true here it takes longer on average in fact the average number of tosses till head tail head is ten and the average number of tosses until head tail tail is eight

PeterDonnelly_2005G-0107579-0108815 so the chance that she's innocent isn't one in seventy three million we don't know what it is it has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statistical evidence
PeterDonnelly_2005G-0118539-0119516 so if a pediatrician had come out and said to a jury i know how to build bridges i've built one down the road please drive your car home over it they would have said well pediatricians don't know how to build bridges that's what engineers do

PeterGabriel_Panel_2013-0009840-0011232 they're aware there have been multitudes of studies with many species over the years that have given us exquisite evidence for thinking and consciousness in other animals other animals that are quite different than we are in form
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013-0028738-0029529 i'm a farm boy i grew up surrounded by animals and i would look in these eyes and wonder what was going on there
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013-0050437-0052130 that night we began to dream and we thought perhaps the most amazing tool that man's created is the internet and what would happen if we could somehow find new interfaces visual audio interfaces that would allow
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013-0085913-0086692 just last year we turned on the production internet you've been using the experimental version for the last thirty years the production version
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013-0096243-0096626 is that they're beginning to learn how to communicate
PeterGabriel_Panel_2013-0112877-0113128 that are wonderful individually to link them globally
PeterHaas_2010G-0009118-0009524 we have all heard about the tremendous human loss
PeterHaas_2010G-0017570-0017840 we inspected schools and private

PeterHaas_2010G-0046907-0047217 is a poorly constructed building that will fail
PeterHirschberg_2007P-0016823-0017414 and then the bottom falls out doesn't work out too well for them they lose money and
PeterHirschberg_2007P-0047641-0048653 project building the a bomb in the first place talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry and you can imagine that the air force became a pretty good salesman here's their marketing video
PeterHirschberg_2007P-0069820-0070313 and a quote that sounds largely reminiscent from everything i've been reading all week
PeterHirschberg_2007P-0092764-0093542 in everybody else's affairs and so the global village is as big as a planet and as small as a
PeterHirschberg_2007P-0122504-0123282 personal matter between the computer and the file system that's fine but as you can see it was about to leap out and upset jack valenti and a lot of other people
PeterHirschberg_2007P-0160213-0162001 could benefit from labor disputes meanwhile you have the tv bloggers going out on strike in sympathy with the television writers and then you have tv guide a fox property which is about to sponsor the online video awards but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television not appearing to gloat
PeterHirschberg_2007P-0187727-0188477 and whereas television may have gotten beat up what's getting built is a really exciting new form of communication and
PeterHirshberg_2007P-0012738-0013675 we go through periods of enthrallment followed by reactions in boardrooms in the finance community best characterized as what's the finance term
PeterHirshberg_2007P-0033495-0033960 and this is the oscilloscope of the whirlwind electronic computer would you

PeterHirshberg_2007P-0063202-0064166 the power would fill up the rest of los angeles that's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of france creates so the next time they tell you they're on to something clearly they're not so
PeterHirshberg_2007P-0080877-0081505 would go on to be perfected with great success as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere
PeterHirshberg_2007P-0089166-0089489 this was a horrible misunderstanding of tv on the part of the
PeterHirshberg_2007P-0095760-0096431 it's actually what we do but for this part of the story i'd actually like to throw it to america's leading technology correspondent john
PeterHirshberg_2007P-0119353-0120392 is to buy a pre made videodisc and hypercard stacks from a commercial supplier the method we illustrate in this video uses a pre made videodisc but creates custom hypercard stacks

PeterHirshberg_2007P-0175257-0176736 here's a man announcing the new market watch from dow jones powered one hundred percent by the user experience on the home page user generated content married up with traditional content it turns out you have a bigger audience and more interest if you hook up with them or as geoffrey moore once told me
PeterHirshberg_2007P-0186055-0186870 i think it's a great time of enthrallment there's been more raw dna of communications and media thrown out there content is moving from shows
PeterMolyneux_2010G-0010491-0010920 i'll be honest with you and say that most of it is just a
PeterMolyneux_2010G-0019465-0019705 actually sculpting a human being
PeterMolyneux_2010G-0028568-0028923 he's now going to use the other thing which is essential and that's his voice

PeterNorvig_2012U-0004186-0005193 in fact i use basically the same technology as this fourteenth century classroom note the textbook
PeterNorvig_2012U-0018776-0020583 one student wrote now i'm seeing bayes networks and examples of game theory everywhere i look and i like that kind of response that's just what we were going for we didn't want students to memorize the formulas we wanted to change the way they looked at the world and we succeeded or i should say the students succeeded
PeterReinhart_2008P-0003222-0004488 but if you think about epoxy what's epoxy it's two resins that are sort of in and of themselves neither of which can make glue but when you put the two together something happens a bond takes place and you get this very strong powerful
PeterReinhart_2008P-0018254-0019152 that brings out flavor it starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch that's what enzymes are doing and so if we can release some of those they become accessible to us
PeterReinhart_2008P-0025171-0026337 which is just a french way of saying get organized everything in its place first stage so in baking we call it scaling weighing out the ingredients stage two is mixing
PeterReinhart_2008P-0037948-0039006 the sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust they give us that beautiful brown crust only the crust can caramelize it's the only place that gets hot enough inside the proteins this gluten
PeterReinhart_2008P-0052778-0053396 and we harvest those seeds and those are the wheat kernels now in order to harvest it i mean what's harvesting it's just a euphemism for
PeterReinhart_2008P-0062472-0062759 leaven comes from the root word that means enliven
PeterReinhart_2008P-0071153-0071861 it's not the staff of life right bread is the staff of life but dough is what we're working with and we take that dough to the oven
PeterReinhart_2008P-0086436-0087500 was we've added into it the spent grain from beer making and if you make this bread you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer i like dark spent grain today we're using a light spent grain that's actually from like
PeterSaul_2011X-0011092-0012188 and over the course of the time i've worked in intensive care the death rate for males in australia has halved and intensive care has had something to do with that certainly a lot of the technologies that we use have got something to do with that
PeterSaul_2011X-0030212-0031883 so a colleague of mine from nursing called lisa shaw and i went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes in the medical records department looking at whether there was any sign at all that anybody had had any conversation about what might happen to them if the treatment they were receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die
PeterSaul_2011X-0042839-0043181 the big growth industry are these
PeterSaul_2011X-0050866-0052274 what we did anyway look what we did we didn't just take this lying down at john hunter hospital and elsewhere we've started a whole series of projects to try and look about whether we could in fact involve people much more in the way that things happen to them
PeterSaul_2011X-0057911-0059144 and when they expressed wishes all of those wishes came true as it were we were able to make that happen for them but then when the funding ran out we went back to look six months later and everybody had stopped again
PeterSaul_2011X-0075505-0076237 so i'm an opponent of euthanasia but i do think we have to give people back some control it deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply
PeterSinger_2013-0009466-0009861 six point nine million children under five
PeterSinger_2013-0023822-0024783 to make sure that what you do is effective and well directed and not only that but also i think reason helps us
PeterSinger_2013-0040488-0041214 they worry how much of a difference they can make but you don't have to be a billionaire this is toby ord
PeterSinger_2013-0050406-0051357 they returned to them and they've decided to cut back on their spending to live modestly and to give both money and time
PeterSinger_2013-0059679-0061002 here's one young man who's taken this advice his name is matt weiger he was a student at princeton in philosophy and math actually won the prize for the best undergraduate philosophy thesis last year when he graduated
PeterSinger_2013-0076491-0077264 so it's very tough if you want to look for other recommendations thelifeyoucansave com and giving what we can both have a somewhat broader list
PeterSinger_2013-0083819-0084659 i don't really believe it is i've enjoyed giving all of my life since i was a graduate student it's been something fulfilling to me
PeterSinger_2013-0091571-0092593 becoming an effective altruist gives you that meaning and fulfillment it enables you to have a solid basis for self esteem on which you can feel your life
PeterTyack_2010Z-0004590-0005415 and what marine mammals have evolved over the last tens of millions of years is ways to depend on sound to both explore their world
PeterTyack_2010Z-0019368-0020524 the setting in which animals need to use this call well let's look at mothers and calves in normal life for mother and calf dolphin they'll often drift apart or swim apart if mom is chasing a fish and when they separate
PeterTyack_2010Z-0034261-0035171 what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area completely and of the ones that stayed their reproductive rate declined so it it could have a negative impact on the whole population
PeterTyack_2010Z-0051126-0051909 it had deep underwater microphones or hydrophones cabled to shore all wired back to a central place that could listen to sounds over the whole north atlantic
PeterTyack_2010Z-0068536-0069322 from a hydrophone five hundred miles away there's a lot of noise which is mostly other whales but you
PeterTyack_2010Z-0079288-0080168 if this signal is used for males and females to find each other for mating and they're dispersed imagine the impact this could have on the recovery of endangered populations
PeterTyack_2010Z-0092388-0093117 and they've already found that by being more intelligent about better propeller design you can reduce that noise by ninety percent
PeterTyack_2010Z-0106324-0107303 so to conclude i'd just like to point out you know the whales live in an amazing acoustic environment they've evolved over tens of millions of years to take advantage of
PeterVanManen_2013X-0011772-0012436 that's twice as many numbers as words that each of us speaks in a lifetime it's a huge amount of data
PeterVanManen_2013X-0023171-0023848 and so one of the challenges you have in health care is how can i look at the patient in front of me
PeterVanManen_2013X-0034254-0036112 the lines on the bottom the blue and the red these are the interesting ones the red line is showing an automated version of the early warning score that birmingham children's hospital were already running they'd been running that since two thousand and eight and already have stopped cardiac arrests and distress within the hospital
PeterWard_2008-0007356-0008680 but complexity which requires a huge amount of evolution and therefore constancy of conditions so in two thousand we wrote rare earth in two thousand and three we then asked let's not think about where earths are in space but how long has earth been earth
PeterWard_2008-0018121-0019146 there we are our planet is a good planet because it can keep water mars is a bad planet but it's still good enough for us to go there and to live on its surface if we're protected
PeterWard_2008-0028951-0029789 or gets blasted by some supernova nearby in the next seven billion years we'll find under your feet but what about accidental death
PeterWard_2008-0044416-0045847 but we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact so this is a type of neo catastrophism and it took about twenty years for the scientific establishment to finally come to grips yes we were hit and yes the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction
PeterWard_2008-0053658-0054887 and the fossils are extraordinary you know you're gazing upon your very distant ancestors these are mammal like reptiles they are culturally invisible we do not make movies about these this is a gorgonopsian or a gorgon
PeterWard_2008-0062665-0063416 we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't here's sort of the end of that ten years of work the ranges of stuff the red line is the mass extinction
PeterWard_2008-0078572-0079620 many of these mass extinction boundaries this is what we find isorenieratene it's very specific it can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen and is totally
PeterWard_2008-0090167-0091269 and we think this is the reason that complexity took so long to take place on planet earth we had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period they stop complex life from existing
PeterWard_2008-0104897-0105430 its temperature drops it goes down to fifteen degrees centigrade from thirty five
PetervanUhm_2011X-0002708-0004391 when i look around this tedxamsterdam venue i see a very special audience you are the reason why i said yes to the invitation to come here today
PetervanUhm_2011X-0021685-0023580 people are confronted with guns they are oppressed they are intimidated by warlords by terrorists by criminals weapons can do a lot of harm they are the cause of much distress
PetervanUhm_2011X-0039362-0040357 he could have done something but with an old gun not even the best marksman in the armed forces could have hit the mark
PetervanUhm_2011X-0057275-0058128 since the end of the cold war statistics show that we are living in a relatively peaceful era
PetervanUhm_2011X-0078942-0079603 failed states do not know of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability

PhilBorges_2006-0004065-0004992 an elder goes to the grave carrying the last spoken word of that culture so an entire philosophy
PhilBorges_2006-0014809-0015655 he was beaten starved tortured lost all his teeth while in prison and when i met him he was a kind gentle old man
PhilBorges_2006-0025318-0026057 so i snuck in a bunch of little wallet sized pictures of the dalai lama and i would hand them out and when i gave them to the people
PhilBorges_2006-0038289-0038716 to non violence in our world one of our living icons
PhilBorges_2006-0051228-0052120 he just he said to us you know i'm an older man now i'm getting tired you know i'm tired of spearing these oil workers i wish they would just go away
PhilBorges_2006-0064097-0064395 we watched and stayed with
PhilBorges_2006-0068955-0069978 having a curriculum where they study different religions just to make a mental flexibility give them a mental flexibility in different belief systems i think this is so
PhilBorges_2006-0075766-0076853 this is i see this rolling out all over this is our site in ollantaytambo peru four years ago where they first saw their first computers now they have computers in their classrooms
PhilBorges_2006-0089052-0089273 sixty percent couldn't find india
PhilHansen_2013-0003119-0003277 the shake developed out of
PhilHansen_2013-0010117-0010812 now i still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism seeing these little tiny dots come together to make this unified whole
PhilHansen_2013-0018799-0018964 and nothing came to mind
PhilHansen_2013-0026298-0026499 we need to first be limited
PhilHansen_2013-0039179-0039523 then assembled the videos into the larger image
PhilHansen_2013-0044887-0045222 let go of failures and let go of imperfections
PhilHansen_2013-0050357-0050686 is the best hope we have to transform ourselves
PhilPlait_2011X-0004208-0006196 it released its energy all at once and it was an explosion that was mind numbing if you took every nuclear weapon ever built at the height of the cold war lumped them together and blew them up at the same time that would be one one millionth of the energy released at that moment
PhilPlait_2011X-0019475-0021244 or your head because it would do that to it that would be bad but it won't wipe out you know all life on earth so that's fine but it turns out you don't need something six miles across to do a lot of damage there is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock and in fact
PhilPlait_2011X-0033224-0035146 they're not going to do global ecological damage they're not going to do something like the dinosaur killer did they're just not big enough but they will do global economic damage because they don't have to hit necessarily to do this kind of damage they don't have to do global devastation if one of these things were to hit
PhilPlait_2011X-0048364-0048719 the earth's gravity will bend it just enough that seven years later
PhilPlait_2011X-0075005-0075226 so think about this right
PhilZimbardo_2008-0009349-0010525 that tells us several things one the world is was will always be filled with good and evil because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition it tells me something else if you remember god's favorite angel was lucifer
PhilZimbardo_2008-0026224-0027017 what i've done is i organized them into various categories but these are by united states military police army reservists
PhilZimbardo_2008-0043204-0044354 that prisoner covered himself with shit every day and they used to have to roll him in dirt so he wouldn't stink but the guards ended up calling him shit boy what was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution
PhilZimbardo_2008-0054835-0055684 effect although it focuses on evil really is a celebration of the human mind's infinite capacity to make any of us kind or cruel
PhilZimbardo_2008-0075303-0075989 so what are the external parallels for all research is artificial what's the validity in the real world nine hundred and twelve american citizens committed suicide
PhilZimbardo_2008-0091580-0091701 with a door with bars
PhilZimbardo_2008-0106581-0107660 the landmark stanford study provides a cautionary tale for all military operations if you give people power without oversight it's a prescription for abuse they knew that and let that happen
PhilZimbardo_2008-0121992-0122181 the good news is i married her the next year
PhilZimbardo_2008-0135485-0136371 because it may only happen once in your life and when you pass it by you'll always know i could have been a hero and i let it pass me by so the point is thinking it and then doing
PhilZimbardo_2009U-0009646-0010456 within one year and most of them did so without using birth control so much for promises now lets tempt four year olds
PhilZimbardo_2009U-0028705-0029325 is the energy the energy to explore yourself places people sensuality
PhilipHoward_2010-0001648-0002727 always been interested in relationship of formal structures and human behavior if you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town people will move there
PhilipHoward_2010-0009561-0010435 just been involved in an episode where a parent had threatened to sue the school because she lowered the grade of the student by ten percent when he turned the paper in late
PhilipHoward_2010-0019468-0019894 you wouldn't want to say something off the cuff that might be used against you
PhilipHoward_2010-0027727-0028562 seek redress in the courts we need regulation to make sure people don't pollute and such we lack even a vocabulary to deal with this problem
PhilipHoward_2010-0037340-0037553 well the healthcare system has been transformed
PhilipHoward_2010-0051109-0052041 seventy eight percent of the middle and high school teachers in america have been threatened by their students with violating your rights with lawsuits by their students they are threatening their student
PhilipHoward_2010-0065460-0065841 in the areas that are regulated there are so many rules no human could possibly know
PhilipHoward_2010-0076068-0076909 so how do you restore trust tweaking the law is clearly not good enough and tort reform which is a great idea lowers your cost if you're a business person
PhilipHoward_2010-0086939-0087673 this is what we have the philosophy we have to change to and there are two essential elements of it we have to simplify the law
PhilipHoward_2010-0092805-0093823 as you're going down and walking down the sidewalk during the day you have to think that if there is a dispute there is somebody in society who sees it as their job
PhilipHoward_2010-0098793-0099779 doesn't mean that people in authority can do whatever they want they are still bounded by legal goals and principles the teacher is accountable to the
PhilipRosedale_2008P-0002549-0003304 just images from a photo stream that is pretty close to live of things that snapshots
PhilipRosedale_2008P-0014315-0015226 would pull this door up you can imagine the amount of time that it took me to do this to the house and the displeasure of my parents the thing that
PhilipRosedale_2008P-0027051-0027687 to space i thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second if you think about going into space
PhilipRosedale_2008P-0050410-0051118 so it's a really large world already in terms of the amount of stuff that's there and that's very important if anybody plays like world of warcraft world
PhilipRosedale_2008P-0064936-0066008 both excite stimulate are able to remember transfer and manipulate data and so virtual worlds are the best way for us to essentially organize and experience information
PhilipRosedale_2008P-0077730-0078497 asking for advice rather than any possible way that you could just statically organize a map
PhilipRosedale_2008P-0090736-0091484 a new way of laying out a city or whatever that stuff historically has never scaled much beyond you know i always laughingly say the mall of america
PhilipRosedale_2008P-0106367-0106782 and it but it closed on day one basically in internet time
PhilipRosedale_2008P-0122397-0123043 a fair criticism is what it is of second life today is that it's more like the wild west than it is like rome
PhilipRosedale_2008P-0135072-0135912 equivalent to i mean these are very nice pictures but in general the graphics are not quite equivalent to the fine tuned graphics that you see in a grand theft auto four
PhilipRosedale_2008P-0150323-0151316 so but i did and i didn't do i think i didn't do as well in school as i could have i think you're right i wasn't like an obsessed you know get a
PhilipZimbardo_2011-0001787-0002721 the demise of guys guys are flaming out academically they're wiping out socially with girls and sexually with women other than that there's not much of a problem
PhilipZimbardo_2011-0023366-0024557 which are analog static interactively passive they're also totally out of sync in romantic relationships which build gradually and subtly so what's the solution it's not my job i'm here to alarm it's your job
PhilipeStarck_2007-0042561-0044276 that is our beautiful story it's our romanticism mu ta tion we are mutants and if we don't deeply understand if we don't integrate that we are mutants we completely miss the story
PhilipeStarck_2007-0086203-0086574 it's nothing because it's not the right time
PhilipeStarck_2007-0101844-0102290 to work even if it's for toilet brush
PhilippePetit_2012-0009470-0010283 for me to start is to pay my respects to the gods of creativity so please join me for a minute of silence
PhilippePetit_2012-0025028-0026118 now i had long admired how fast and fluidly jugglers make objects fly so that's it i'm fourteen i'm becoming a juggler
PhilippePetit_2012-0035233-0035975 now i have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood so that's it i'm sixteen i'm becoming a wire walker
PhilippePetit_2012-0047039-0047514 so i started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission
PhilippePetit_2012-0057467-0057816 which is three tons tight ready to explode
PhilippePetit_2012-0082380-0082726 now improvisation is empowering because
PhilippePetit_2012-0110415-0110766 please take this music with you home and start
PhilippeStarck_2007-0007795-0008579 about something else we can start if you want by understanding it's just to start it's not interesting but
PhilippeStarck_2007-0023657-0024479 anything but when i come back i can understand why i shall not do it because today to not
PhilippeStarck_2007-0033646-0034856 so stupid the most stupid bacteria even i think we copy our way to reproduce you know what i mean and something of
PhilippeStarck_2007-0042882-0043954 we are mutants and if we don't deeply understand if we don't integrate that we are mutants we completely miss the story
PhilippeStarck_2007-0051911-0053053 but perhaps because you walk with the eyes like that you will not see oh there is a hole and you will fall and you will die dangerous that's why perhaps you will try
PhilippeStarck_2007-0063340-0063907 trap one trap the vertical because at the vertical of us if you look like that
PhilippeStarck_2007-0072717-0073470 that this line is ack ack ack ack ack like that it's made of light
PhilippeStarck_2007-0085177-0086560 to try to do it the best possible but i know that even i do it the best possible that's why i'm the best it's nothing because it's not the right time that's why i say that i say that
PhilippeStarck_2007-0100036-0101157 we give you white pages invent we give you the best tools the best tools and now do
PicoIyer_2013G-0007142-0007717 and if where do you come from means where do you pay your taxes where do you see your doctor and your dentist
PicoIyer_2013G-0015313-0016244 and their whole life will be spent taking pieces of many different places and putting them together into a stained glass whole
PicoIyer_2013G-0029116-0029835 two hundred and twenty million and that's an almost unimaginable number but it means
PicoIyer_2013G-0044352-0045091 and potentially everything about the way that young woman dreams about the world writes about the world
PicoIyer_2013G-0060308-0061782 and when i got out of my car the air was pulsing the whole place was absolutely silent but the silence wasn't an absence of noise it was really a presence of a kind of energy or quickening
PicoIyer_2013G-0076225-0078150 and of course i'm not suggesting that anybody here go into a monastery that's not the point but i do think it's only by stopping movement that you can see where to go and it's only by stepping out of your life and the world that you can see what you most deeply care about
PranavMistry_2009I-0010684-0011391 and i actually wanted more so i borrowed another mouse from a friend never returned to him and i now had four rollers
PranavMistry_2009I-0024949-0025566 what we are interested in is information we want to know about things we want to know about dynamic things going
PranavMistry_2009I-0041022-0042286 so we are looking for an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world and of course if you don't have any surface you can start using your palm for simple operations here i'm dialing a phone number just using my hand
PranavMistry_2009I-0054971-0055830 and then just pinched that like i just made a clip out of the microphone and clipped that to a piece of paper any paper that you found
PranavMistry_2009I-0073640-0074324 i'm trying to make this more available to people so that anyone can develop their own sixthsense device because the hardware is actually not that
QuyenNguyen_2011P-0011222-0011502 with plenty of windows to let light in
QuyenNguyen_2011P-0026563-0027113 that piece out so we go back and we do that again and again and this
QuyenNguyen_2011P-0057254-0057633 you have to cut it out bring it back home
QuyenNguyen_2011P-0080068-0080303 do you guys know where the margins of this tumor
QuyenNguyen_2011P-0091197-0091518 i'd like to leave you with this final thought
RAMashelkar_2009I-0013659-0014509 is absolutely true it's not just ratan tata it's the house of tatas over time let me confirm what she said yes i went
RAMashelkar_2009I-0023075-0023910 and incredible car and of course nothing succeeds like success the cynics then turned around and one after the other
RAMashelkar_2009I-0032424-0032783 huge co creation with vendors and suppliers all ideas on board
RAMashelkar_2009I-0046135-0046699 nano and you can see there is a physical space that has been created for him
RAMashelkar_2009I-0059853-0061040 a quick molding and modular components enabling custom made on the spot limb fitments you could feel it actually in an hour by the way whereas the equivalent other feet took something like a day
RAMashelkar_2009I-0084117-0085167 you can see before treatment and after treatment this is really getting more from less for more and more people because these are all affordable treatments now let me just
RAMashelkar_2009I-0105208-0105807 a story that drove me that transformed my life i remember i went to a poor school because
RachelArmstrong_2009G-0006556-0007295 and this is the conversion of one group of substances into another either through the production or the absorption of energy
RachelArmstrong_2009G-0017559-0018323 so what we're trying to do is we're trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom up construction approaches for architecture which contrast
RachelArmstrong_2009G-0030524-0031332 and depositing it in a very complex environment against natural materials we're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this
RachelBotsman_2010X-0001653-0002870 today i'm going to talk to you about the rise of collaborative consumption i'm going to explain what it is and try and convince you in just fifteen minutes that this isn't a flimsy idea or a short term
RachelBotsman_2010X-0016926-0017622 now there are layers of technical wonder behind sites such as swaptree but that's not my interest and
RachelBotsman_2010X-0031564-0031908 actually it was a complicated web of seemingly disconnected
RachelBotsman_2010X-0041455-0041936 system called hyper consumption came along and we built these fences and created out
RachelBotsman_2010X-0056216-0057097 and although they vary enormously in scale maturity and purpose when we dived into them we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems
RachelBotsman_2010X-0069588-0070595 i want to just give you an example of how powerful collaborative consumption can be to change behaviors the average car costs dollar eight thousand a year to run
RachelBotsman_2010X-0079485-0080510 our relationship to satisfying what we want is far less tangible than any other previous generation i don't want the dvd i want the movie is carries
RachelBotsman_2010X-0087768-0088525 much because our credit history was far more important that any kind of peer to peer review but now with the web we
RachelBotsman_2010X-0093043-0093504 it's a new social currency so to speak that could become as powerful as our credit rating
RachelBotsman_2010X-0096941-0097877 i'm on a mission to make sharing cool i'm on a mission to make sharing hip because i really believe it can disrupt outdated modes of business
RachelBotsman_2012G-0017056-0019032 from skills to spaces to material possessions in ways and on a scale never possible before it's an economy and culture called collaborative consumption and through it people like sebastian are becoming micro entrepreneurs they're empowered to make money and save money from their existing assets
RachelBotsman_2012G-0043947-0044986 now the way taskrabbit works is people outsource the tasks that they want doing name the price they're willing to pay and then vetted rabbits bid to run the errand yes
RachelBotsman_2012G-0065863-0066349 the difference today is that with every trade we make comment we leave
RachelBotsman_2012G-0085239-0085751 how you can aggregate monitor and use your online reputation
RachelBotsman_2012G-0103345-0105269 and that recruiters were searching the platform to find people with unique talents now thousands of programmers today are finding better jobs this way because stack overflow and the reputation dashboards provide a priceless window into how someone really behaves and what their peers think of them
RachelPike_2009G-0013018-0014080 our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each on minute timescales and it takes weeks to perform our integrations and we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening
RachelSussman_2010G-0005295-0006419 the project is part art and part science there's an environmental component and i'm also trying to create a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time and to start to consider a deeper
RachelSussman_2010G-0021654-0023016 is actually a predatory fungus killing certain species of trees in the forest it's also more benignly known as the honey mushroom or the humongous fungus because it happens to be one of the world's largest organisms as well
RachelSussman_2010G-0037457-0038703 as it's gotten warmer on the top of the mountain the vegetation zone is actually changing so we don't even necessarily have to have direct contact with these organisms to have a very real impact on them
RachelSussman_2010G-0048705-0049788 and you know i think of all of these organisms as palimpsests they contain thousands of years of their own histories within themselves and they also contain records of natural and human events
RachelSussman_2010G-0060578-0061476 this is what i think is the most poetic of the oldest living things this is something called an underground forest so i spoke to a botanist at the pretoria botanical garden
RachelSussman_2010G-0073727-0074645 and what they found by doing research into the permafrost was this bacteria but what's unique about it is that it's doing dna repair below freezing
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G-0006368-0007087 they are inherently unstable and they need some form of automatic feedback control in order to be able to fly
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G-0021446-0022005 it goes back to the nice balanced position
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G-0037372-0038177 we've all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured can a machine also perform with extreme physical damage
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G-0046273-0046526 or to design clever algorithms that
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G-0056233-0057610 this quad has a racket strapped onto its head with a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple so not too large the following calculations are made every twenty milliseconds or fifty times per second we first figure out where the ball is going
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G-0069435-0070535 similar to the pointer that i used earlier we can use this as inputs to the system we now have a natural way of interacting with the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures
RaffaelloDAndrea_2013G-0089606-0090138 some conjecture that the role of play in the animal kingdom is to hone skills and develop capabilities
RaghavaKK_2010-0006456-0007736 i'm not on top of the class so for me cartooning gave me a sense of identity i got popular but i was scared i'd get caught again so what i did was i quickly put together a collage of all the teachers i had drawn
RaghavaKK_2010-0020282-0020444 my home town bangalore
RaghavaKK_2010-0031498-0032456 that i need to take a break i quit my job at the papers i closed my school and i wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks and i decided to go traveling
RaghavaKK_2010-0050960-0052084 and i must say i spent time in the bronx working with these kids and in exchange for me working with them they taught me how to be cool i don't think i've succeeded but they've taught me they said stop
RaghavaKK_2010-0064979-0066009 so what we did was we rented a little van and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it she contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work
RaghavaKK_2010-0078641-0078977 another thing happened i lost all my audiences
RaghavaKK_2010-0088868-0089160 it was time to end and go back home
RaghavaKK_2010-0098653-0099111 i want to leave you with one story that really really inspired me i met belinda
RaghavaKK_2011G-0002116-0003515 thank you and i want to share with you my latest art project it's a children's book for the ipad it's a little quirky and silly it's called pop it and it's about the things little kids do with their parents
RaghavaKK_2011G-0022291-0023851 for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage after all children's books are manuals on parenting so you better give them children's books that teach them perspectives and conversely only when you teach perspectives
RaghavaKK_2012S-0014866-0015358 you know i never really believed in legacy what am i going to leave behind i'm an artist
RaghavaKK_2012S-0036861-0037721 when i think of the future i never see myself moving forward in time i actually see time moving backward towards me
RaghavaKK_2012S-0048978-0049327 and when i'm done you can study about it
RaghavaKK_2012S-0053429-0053685 history as an imaging tool
RaghavaKK_2012S-0061620-0063429 i'd like to make the argument that creativity is the most important tool we have it lets us create who we are and curate what is to come i like to think thank you i like to think of myself as a storyteller where my past and my future
RajeshRao_2011-0011789-0012295 what archeologists have found is none of that they've found small objects such as these
RajeshRao_2011-0031066-0032206 we don't know but perhaps if you deciphered the script you would be able to answer this question but deciphering the script is a very challenging task first there's no rosetta stone i don't mean the software i mean an ancient artifact
RajeshRao_2011-0056723-0057560 and we can use the computer model now to try to complete this text and make a best guess prediction here's an example of a symbol that was predicted
RajeshRao_2011-0088472-0090033 and it turns out that in india there's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and star constellations present at the time of birth in dravidian languages the word for fish is meen which happens to sound just like the word for star
RalphLangner_2011-0009381-0010172 the only thing that was known is it's very very complex on the windows part the dropper part used multiple zero day vulnerabilities
RalphLangner_2011-0027969-0028382 their expertise with what we found in code and data
RalphLangner_2011-0042447-0043366 now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors so for example from pressure sensors and vibration sensors
RalphLangner_2011-0055477-0055954 that's the consequence that we have to face
RameshRaskar_2012G-0008092-0009501 now if i take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trillionth of a second which is several femtoseconds i'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide
RameshRaskar_2012G-0029247-0030301 so in the future when this femto camera is in your camera phone you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it
RameshRaskar_2012G-0052800-0053769 now like doc edgerton a scientist himself science became art an art of ultra fast photography
RamonaPierson_2011X-0005042-0006743 i was running across the street and the only thing that i actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head and i remember putting my hands on the ground and feeling my life's blood emptying out of my neck and my mouth
RamonaPierson_2011X-0018560-0019205 and i ended up with a plastic nose porcelain teeth and all kinds of other things but eventually i started to look human again
RamonaPierson_2011X-0042676-0043349 so i'm going to just leave it to your imagination as to what my first words were
RamonaPierson_2011X-0056834-0057279 the biggest change for me was that the world moved forward
RamseyMusallam_2013S-0001299-0001511 teach chemistry
RamseyMusallam_2013S-0009200-0010525 all technology or buzzwords in education but if we place these technologies before student inquiry we can be robbing ourselves of our greatest tool as teachers
RamseyMusallam_2013S-0017128-0018338 with a two year old at home and my second child on the way i was diagnosed with a large aneurysm at the base of my thoracic aorta this led to open heart surgery this is the actual real email from my doctor right
RamseyMusallam_2013S-0027845-0028027 and rule number three
RamseyMusallam_2013S-0034176-0034666 you see i would argue that riley is a metaphor for all kids
RaulMidonANSWERS_2007-0007944-0008239 anyway this is a song about
RaulMidonANSWERS_2007-0021532-0021578 the
RaulMidonANSWERS_2007-0040780-0041670 and the song is based on what i think was my first sort of childhood attempts
RaulMidonANSWERS_2007-0058580-0058902 power a a had a name a a it's the
RaulMidonEVERYBODY_2007-0008237-0008546 picture a world where the

RaulMidon_Tembererana_2007-0038918-0039609 this next song is a song that started out as a dream a childhood dream
RavinAgrawal_2009I-0006925-0007495 she also creates life size fiberglass sculptures often of animals which she then completely covers in
RavinAgrawal_2009I-0024549-0025251 he creates these opulent tableaus inspired by hieronymus bosch but also by the kashmiri textiles of his youth
RayAnderson_2009-0003317-0004414 in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind and the resulting decline of the biosphere that culprit is business and industry
RayAnderson_2009-0017687-0018453 ninety nine asked later in the canadian documentary the corporation what i meant by the go to jail remark
RayAnderson_2009-0029442-0030395 i equals p times a divided by t now the mathematically minded will see immediately that t in the numerator increases impact a bad thing but
RayAnderson_2009-0035193-0035714 i realized that all those attributes must be changed to move t to the denominator
RayAnderson_2009-0042830-0044067 this is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by two thousand and fifty to avoid catastrophic climate disruption so the scientists are telling us
RayAnderson_2009-0058310-0059502 is the business case for sustainability from real life experience costs are down not up reflecting some four hundred million dollars of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste
RayAnderson_2009-0067804-0068696 i equals p times a divided by t two that a is a capital a suggesting that affluence is an end in itself
RayAnderson_2009-0079591-0080491 of the biosphere a very dear person is at risk here frankly an unacceptable risk who is that person not you not
RayAnderson_2009-0092471-0092653 planet to hurt it
RayKurzweil_2005-0013519-0014374 for some thirty years i realized that my technologies had to make sense when i finished the project that invariably the world was a different place
RayKurzweil_2005-0027180-0028055 few years of the project it took us fifteen years to sequence hiv we sequenced sars in thirty one days so we are gaining the potential to overcome
RayKurzweil_2005-0043445-0044483 on the same and these people were not trying to make my point these were just lists in reference works and i think that's what they thought the key events were in biological evolution and technological evolution
RayKurzweil_2005-0063926-0064763 very accurately it's the same thing here we can't predict any particular project but the result of this whole worldwide chaotic unpredictable
RayKurzweil_2005-0078443-0079855 work out so well that was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago we'd like to actually turn that program off they tried that in animals and these mice ate ravenously and remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim they didn't get diabetes
RayKurzweil_2005-0096832-0097552 in its intricacy once we understand its principles of operation and the pace with which we are reverse engineering biology is accelerating
RayKurzweil_2005-0124883-0125645 up the environment providing fuel powerful fuel cells and widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment
RayKurzweil_2009U-0004738-0005834 take thirty steps exponentially two four eight sixteen i get to a billion it makes a huge difference and that really describes information technology when i was a student at mit
RayKurzweil_2009U-0022807-0023575 in constant dollars in every form of information technology for the last half century despite the fact that you can get twice as much of it each year
RayKurzweil_2009U-0037905-0038848 in twenty five years and we will begin to actually deeply influence our health and our intelligence as we get closer and closer to this technology
RayKurzweil_2009U-0050487-0051650 so we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten from both the intellectual leaders the high tech leaders particularly google and nasa this is an exciting new venture and we invite you to participate thank you very much
RayZahab_2009-0006664-0007478 on your antarctic trek it's going to be forty below every single day you'll be in a massive headwind and at some point you're going to have to cross these cracks in the ice these
RayZahab_2009-0015027-0016010 to come up with this expedition a run to the south pole where with an interactive website i will be able to bring young people students and teachers from around the world on board the expedition with me
RayZahab_2009-0031095-0031892 a pack a day smoker living a very sedentary lifestyle what i take from this journey from my journeys is that in fact
ReadMontague_2012G-0013715-0015121 put people into functional mri devices and image how these kinds of variables map onto brain activity it's in its early stages and it's crude by some measures but in fact twenty years ago we were at nothing you couldn't do people like this you couldn't do healthy people
ReadMontague_2012G-0035559-0037340 here's a couple they're sharing a moment together and we've even done an experiment where you can cut out different pieces of this frame and you can still see that they're sharing it they're sharing it sort of in parallel now the elements of the scene also communicate this to us but you can read it straight off their faces and if you compare their faces to normal faces it would be a very subtle cue
ReadMontague_2012G-0055737-0057679 people come to the table and even these very blunt staged social interactions and they and there's just numbers going back and forth between the people and they bring enormous sensitivities to it so we realized we could exploit this and in fact as we've done that and we've done this now in many thousands of people i think on the order of
ReadMontague_2012G-0070462-0072413 early days and we're just beginning we're setting up sites around the world here are a few of our collaborating sites the hub ironically enough is centered in little roanoke virginia there's another hub in london now and the rest are getting set up we hope to give the data away at some stage
RebeccaMacKinnon_2011G-0014213-0014501 that are often quite arbitrary
RebeccaMacKinnon_2011G-0028252-0028483 files were left behind intact
RebeccaMacKinnon_2011G-0043843-0044503 so we assume that the internet is a border busting technology this is a map of
RebeccaMacKinnon_2011G-0058523-0059174 this has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the internet to hold government accountable
RebeccaMacKinnon_2011G-0070330-0072127 violation of citizens right to communications and has raised questions amongst civil society groups about whether some political representatives are more interested in preserving the interests of the entertainment industry than they are in defending the rights of their citizens
RebeccaMacKinnon_2011G-0083207-0084646 so now we need to figure out how to build consent of the networked and what does that look like at the moment we still don't know but it's going to require innovation
RebeccaOnie_2012P-0008567-0010439 far more effective i have to say than anything i later learned in law school but over the course of these nine months i grew frustrated with feeling like we were intervening too far downstream in the lives of our clients that by the time they came to us they were already in crisis
RebeccaOnie_2012P-0024844-0026186 so eighteen months ago i got this email that changed my life and the email was from dr jack geiger who had written to congratulate me on health leads and to share as he said a bit of historical context
RebeccaOnie_2012P-0042507-0043952 what if we decided to make a different set of choices what if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare that have drifted away from us and stand firm and say no these things are ours they will be used for
RebeccaOnie_2012P-0064074-0065322 so it's a brutal winter in the northeast your kid has asthma your heat just got turned off and of course you're in the waiting room of the er because the cold air triggered your child's asthma but what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously
RebeccaOnie_2012P-0073510-0074923 college sports teams say we're going to take dozens of hours at some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning and we're going to measure your performance and your team's performance and if you don't measure up or you don't show up we're going to cut you off the team
RebeccaOnie_2012P-0081420-0081768 and the thing is there's thousands of these folks already out there
RebeccaSaxe_2009G-0002434-0003261 how can we know whether other people have minds that is maybe you have a mind and everyone else is just a really convincing robot
RebeccaSaxe_2009G-0013866-0014613 simple units simple messages over space and time in a network and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds
RebeccaSaxe_2009G-0025328-0025860 yeah so ivan has this cheese sandwich and he says yum yum yum yum yum i really love cheese sandwiches
RebeccaSaxe_2009G-0042718-0043336 that we get what looks more like an adult response r s should ivan get in trouble for taking joshua's sandwich
RebeccaSaxe_2009G-0052277-0053066 so grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory and they take a break for coffee and grace's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee
RebeccaSaxe_2009G-0067175-0067993 and we do have such a tool it's called trans cranial magnetic stimulation or tms this is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse
RebeccaSaxe_2009G-0080013-0080961 but i want to give the last word back to the novelists and to philip roth who ended by saying the fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway
RebeccaSaxe_2009G-0093156-0093889 until recently what we knew about the brain were the things that any other animal's brain could do too so we could study it in animal models we knew how brains
ReedKroloff_2003-0006504-0007902 talk about architecture a little bit within the subject of creation and optimism and if you put creation and optimism together you've got two choices that you can talk about you can talk about creationism

ReedKroloff_2003-0033371-0034534 i mean romantic in the sense of there are things larger and grander than us so in the american tradition the difference between the technocratic and the romantic would be the difference between
ReedKroloff_2003-0046492-0047342 is their isometric drawings of what will be a large scale camera obscura in a public park does everybody know what a camera obscura is
ReedKroloff_2003-0057859-0058666 and so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off site and delivered on a truck to the site
ReedKroloff_2003-0072180-0073091 and the redevelopment of the west side they were asked to design replace that bridge in six weeks building it including all of the parts manufactured

ReggieWatts_2012-0006396-0006730 what everything is
ReggieWatts_2012-0035014-0035847 now with the allocation and the understanding of the lack of understanding we enter into a new era of science in which we feel
ReginaDugan_2012-0006266-0006458 ask yourself this question
ReginaDugan_2012-0011565-0012637 because it's not failure itself that constrains us the path to truly new never been done before things always has failure along the way
ReginaDugan_2012-0024376-0024746 and he flew towards an unknown
ReginaDugan_2012-0035201-0036715 it's boosted to near space atop a minotaur iv rocket now the minotaur iv has too much impulse so we have to bleed it off by flying the rocket at an eighty nine degree angle of attack for portions of the trajectory
ReginaDugan_2012-0044195-0044803 and while there's no substitute for speed maneuverability is a very close second
ReginaDugan_2012-0054317-0054575 it
ReginaDugan_2012-0069401-0070662 today we are making metals that are lighter than styrofoam so light they can sit atop a dandelion puff and be blown away with a wisp of air
ReginaDugan_2012-0078036-0078269 a human has controlled a robot
ReginaDugan_2012-0080899-0081624 tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months
ReginaDugan_2012-0088732-0089038 it allows us to contribute
ReginaDugan_2012-0096282-0096527 if we defy the impossible
ReginaDugan_2012-0103233-0103525 it's hard to hold onto this feeling
ReginaDugan_2012-0111732-0111971 and still today
ReginaDugan_2012-0128405-0128595 the
RennyGleeson_2009-0005642-0006215 how we deal with this from a public standpoint so we've developed certain tactics and strategies to
RennyGleeson_2009-0020450-0021726 we are creating the technology that is going to create the new shared experience which will create the new world and so my request is please let's make technologies that make people more human and not less
RennyGleeson_2012U-0020108-0020841 so you take a look out in the real world and the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself you can type in an url and put in a four hundred and four and these will pop
ReubenMargolin_2012-0004396-0005435 it adds together the interference pattern from two raindrops that land near each other instead of expanding circles they're expanding hexagons
ReubenMargolin_2012-0025085-0025302 strings attached to dancers

RicElias_2011U-0005316-0006071 the pilot lines up the plane with the hudson river that's usually not the route
RichardBaraniuk_2006-0003181-0003810 ok so these are lp records and they've been replaced right they've been
RichardBaraniuk_2006-0018885-0020007 as a massive itunes right for book type content and then take that material and imagine making it all open so that people can modify it play with it improve it
RichardBaraniuk_2006-0030461-0031274 right that covers the entire area of electrical engineering and not only that it can be customized for use in each of their own individual institutions
RichardBaraniuk_2006-0052217-0053220 trying to create the physical instantiation of one of these courses and i think a lot of you received i think all of you received one of these music books in your
RichardBaraniuk_2006-0061661-0062691 under this long tail to sustain open projects like ours but also to sustain this new emergence of on demand publishers like coop who produced these two books
RichardBaraniuk_2006-0072877-0073751 we came up with this six and a half years ago because i teach the stuff in the red box and my day job as chris said i'm an electrical engineering professor
RichardBaraniuk_2006-0089880-0090636 you must learn about it creativecommons org at the bottom of every piece of material in connexions and in lots of other projects
RichardBaraniuk_2006-0104161-0105054 and peer review comes in ok you come to ted why do you come to ted because chris and his team have ensured that things are very very high quality
RichardBranson_2007-0009963-0010589 finding the right people inspiring those people you know drawing out the best in people and
RichardBranson_2007-0022376-0023088 post napster you're looking like a bit of a genius actually for that as well rb yeah as it turned out
RichardBranson_2007-0036568-0036966 never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that
RichardBranson_2007-0049515-0050151 if you're having problems getting a booking in a restaurant or something that might be worth using it ca you know it's not richard branson it's
RichardBranson_2007-0053703-0053807 take a ride into space
RichardBranson_2007-0058109-0058322 is quite erratic so i think that he wouldn't be the best
RichardBranson_2007-0069463-0069859 crossing every finger praying that the balloon would hold together which
RichardBranson_2007-0078388-0079131 and then finally just thought there's a better way i've got you know this enormous balloon above me it's the biggest parachute
RichardBranson_2007-0091003-0091523 didn't weren't you just terrible at school rb i was dyslexic
RichardBranson_2007-0102424-0102781 yeah i think i was a bit of a maverick
RichardBranson_2007-0112370-0113021 both i think i went to prison first i was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the
RichardBranson_2007-0126777-0127208 i don't actually think that the stereotype of a business person
RichardBranson_2007-0138801-0139014 i think it's important that the individuals
RichardBranson_2007-0150784-0151935 practices so for instance there's a doctor in africa that's found that if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at twenty four weeks
RichardBranson_2007-0161505-0162339 clinics in africa where we're going to be giving free antiretroviral drugs free tb treatment and free malaria treatment but
RichardBranson_2007-0172204-0173009 i just want to live life to its full you know if i can make a difference i hope to be able to
RichardDawkins_2002-0007915-0008454 now of course we know that he didn't really mean that but in this country at the moment you
RichardDawkins_2002-0022139-0022976 in fact of course educated theologians from the pope down are firm in their support of evolution this book finding darwin's god by kenneth miller
RichardDawkins_2002-0034121-0034982 difficult problem for any theory of biological design is to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things
RichardDawkins_2002-0054508-0055400 but to have an opinion about how the universe began about who created the universe no that's holy so we're used to not challenging
RichardDawkins_2002-0066588-0067061 it has been privately revealed to professor huxtane
RichardDawkins_2002-0074196-0075042 bush's bigotry was not an isolated mistake blurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted he stood by it in the face of repeated calls
RichardDawkins_2002-0082464-0083571 however we define atheism it's surely the kind of academic belief that a person is entitled to hold without being vilified as an unpatriotic unelectable non citizen
RichardDawkins_2002-0099694-0100589 that meta anaysis but i would like to see more studies done along those lines and i know that there are if i could put a little plug here there are people in this audience
RichardDawkins_2002-0113096-0113679 not a citizen of this country so i hope it won't be thought unbecoming if i suggest that something needs to be done
RichardDawkins_2002-0123719-0124826 darwin said i have never been an atheist in the same sense as denying the existence of a god i think that generally an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind
RichardDawkins_2002-0141806-0142804 the onus is on you to say why the onus is not on the rest of us to say why not we who are atheists are also a fairiests and
RichardDawkins_2002-0153931-0154871 use the word god they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep mysterious part of physics which we don't yet understand
RichardDawkins_2002-0167061-0167831 but i also suspect that a fair number of those secretly despise religion as much as i do
RichardDawkins_2005G-0005908-0006728 yet the assumptions that quantum theory needs to make in order to deliver those predictions are so mysterious that even feynman himself
RichardDawkins_2005G-0016402-0017444 queerer than we can suppose what is it that makes us capable of supposing anything and does this tell us anything about what we can suppose
RichardDawkins_2005G-0030649-0031402 we never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms if we had our brains probably would perceive rocks as full of empty space
RichardDawkins_2005G-0042142-0042493 atoms he quickened his pace almost to a jog now
RichardDawkins_2005G-0051752-0052484 steve grand he's the one on the left douglas adams is on the right steve grand in his book creation life and how to make it
RichardDawkins_2005G-0063354-0064321 not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you
RichardDawkins_2005G-0076709-0077518 bats i even suggested use perceived hues such as red and blue as labels internal labels for
RichardDawkins_2005G-0089646-0090659 middle world is the narrow range of reality which we judge to be normal as opposed to the queerness of the very small the very large and the very fast
RichardDawkins_2005G-0100505-0101214 if if life could i mean life could originate once per planet could be extremely common or it could originate once per
RichardDawkins_2005G-0104636-0105931 i don't think we shall have to avail ourselves of that because i suspect that life is quite common in the universe and when i say quite common it could still be so rare that no one island of life ever encounters another
RichardDawkins_2005G-0113132-0113867 most scientists today subscribe to a mechanistic view of the mind we're the way we are because our brains are wired up as they are
RichardDawkins_2005G-0127646-0128775 if the universe is queerer than we can suppose is it just because we've been naturally selected to suppose only what we needed to suppose in order to survive in the pleistocene of africa
RichardPreston_2008-0008842-0009188 in recent historic times about ninety six percent
RichardPreston_2008-0019026-0019316 maybe about here about thirty feet
RichardPreston_2008-0029820-0030357 that is to say at that time it was believed that there was nothing up there except the branches of redwood trees
RichardPreston_2008-0039610-0039944 they don't seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do
RichardPreston_2008-0050930-0052026 there are epiphytes plants that grow on trees these are huckleberry bushes many species of mosses and then all sorts of lichens just plastering the tree
RichardPreston_2008-0061498-0062154 gives you an idea what you're seeing here is a hierarchical schematic development of the trunks of this tree
RichardPreston_2008-0065846-0065959 who look like us
RichardPreston_2008-0069259-0070132 these are millennial structures portions of the tree that are believed to be more than one thousand years old there are four humans in this shot one two
RichardPreston_2008-0083774-0084198 i have to show you something unfortunately very sad at the conclusion of this talk
RichardPreston_2008-0094786-0095485 the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in north america
RichardPreston_2008-0108515-0109274 and in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again and so no specimens have ever been collected we don't know what it is we just know it's there
RichardPyle_2004-0009180-0009989 now when you think of a coral reef this is what most people think of all these big hard elaborate corals and lots of bright colorful fishes and things but this is really just the tip of the iceberg
RichardPyle_2004-0021926-0023185 now if you were to go down to say three hundred feet you don't have five times as many gas molecules in your lungs you've got ten times as many gas molecules in your lungs and sure enough they dissolve into your blood and tissues as well and of course if you were to down
RichardPyle_2004-0049358-0050242 now normally you don't have to do that because all of it's done automatically for you with the electronics the third system of a rebreather the most critical part of a rebreather are the oxygen sensors
RichardPyle_2004-0074704-0075742 as a fish nerd i have to laugh because you know they don't call us fish nerds for nothing we actually do get excited about finding a new dorsal spine in a guppy but it's much more than that
RichardPyle_2004-0086264-0087268 quickly we find them we're up to seven new species per hour of time we spend at that depth now if you go to an amazon jungle and fog a tree you may get a lot of bugs but for fishes
RichardPyle_2004-0093497-0094323 the reason i show this not to put a downer on everything but i just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general which is that we all have two goals
RichardResnick_2011X-0008982-0009478 that the world has completely changed and none of you know about it so
RichardResnick_2011X-0021470-0022323 she goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later so first the way in which this woman was treated in as little as ten years will look like bloodletting
RichardResnick_2011X-0036032-0037245 his pediatrician happens to have a background in clinical genetics and he has no idea what's going on but he says let's get this kid's genome sequenced and what they find is a single point mutation in a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death
RichardResnick_2011X-0058710-0059675 and a third cousin's genome was also sitting there and there was software that could compare these two and make these associations not hard to imagine my company has software that does this right now
RichardSears_2010U-0012447-0013363 now it's about thirty five percent it's been declining and i believe it will continue to decline gasoline consumption in the u s probably peaked in two thousand and seven and is declining
RichardSears_2010U-0027683-0028962 just in case you weren't already guessing it's calcium carbonate it's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this but it's not the same stuff it's different it's thousands of times maybe three thousand times tougher
RichardSears_2010U-0037880-0039310 it's because well thousands of years ago people invented ideas they had ideas innovations technology and the stone age ended not because we ran out of stones
RichardSeymour_2011S-0024296-0025885 these are the bits the pleasure centers and maybe what i'm seeing and sensing and feeling is bypassing my thinking the wiring from your sensory apparatus to those bits is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit the cortex they arrive first
RichardSeymour_2011S-0054140-0055482 a sensation of delight and beauty if i look at that eye i'm not getting it off the eyebrow and the earhole isn't doing it to me at all so i don't know how much this is helping me but it's helping to guide me to the places where the signals are coming off
RichardSeymour_2011S-0089500-0090774 so is that wrong well in this case it isn't because it's a very very ecologically sound piece of technology but you're a slave of that first flash we are slaves to the first few
RichardSt.John_2005-0010864-0012168 david gallo says push yourself physically mentally you've gotta push push push you gotta push through shyness and self doubt goldie hawn says i always had self doubts i wasn't good enough i wasn't smart enough i didn't think i'd make it
RichardStJohn_2005-0005868-0006264 and makes ted sters tick and the first thing is passion
RichardStJohn_2005-0018956-0019196 pay four thousand bucks and come to ted
RichardStJohn_2009U-0019499-0020588 business grew bigger than ever and when i went back to following these eight principles the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether and i woke up one day and i said i don't need prozac anymore
RichardTurere_2013-0021431-0021659 so i set up everything
RichardTurere_2013-0031612-0031801 my new school now is coming in
RichardWeller_2012X-0004053-0005119 but moving into work and we have each week what's called a journal club when you'd sit down with the other doctors and you'd study a scientific paper in relation to medicine
RichardWeller_2012X-0020196-0022003 so what i'm going to suggest is that vitamin d is not the only story in town it's not the only reason preventing heart disease high vitamin d levels i think are a marker for sunlight exposure and sunlight exposure in methods i'm going to show is good for heart disease
RichardWeller_2012X-0036429-0038136 it seemed we couldn't turn off the production of nitric oxide in the skin of humans we put on creams that blocked the enzyme that made it we injected things we couldn't turn off the nitric oxide and the reason for this it turned out after two or three years work
RichardWeller_2012X-0055209-0055880 in the arm you can measure blood flow in the arm by how much it swells up as some blood flows into it
RichardWeller_2012X-0073730-0074924 i actually think a far more important message is that there are benefits as well as risks to sunlight yes sunlight is the major alterable risk factor for skin cancer
RichardWilkinson_2011G-0011561-0012375 or social position social status where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us
RichardWilkinson_2011G-0022930-0023247 which i shall use over and over again in the data
RichardWilkinson_2011G-0034496-0035462 it's about fifteen percent of the population who feel they can trust others but in the more equal societies it rises to sixty or sixty five percent
RichardWilkinson_2011G-0049978-0051229 it's actually a measure of mobility based on income basically it's asking do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons or is there no relationship between the two
RichardWilkinson_2011G-0066027-0066795 i am not talking about perfect equality i'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies
RichardWilkinson_2011G-0080186-0081023 the social evaluative judgments increase the fear of those social evaluative judgments
RichardWilkinson_2011G-0095662-0096385 or for instance the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people
RickSmolan_2007P-0015163-0015934 she could just put up her hand and say stop and i would stop taking pictures and then my translator left so there i was i couldn't speak a word of korean and this is the first night
RickSmolan_2007P-0025224-0026123 was to not pay attention to me and so she really just completely ignored me most of the time i noticed that at recess she was the girl who picked the other girls to be on her team
RickSmolan_2007P-0040030-0040740 my friends actually said they were very interested in adopting her and i said look i think i'll scare the grandmother to death if i actually
RickSmolan_2007P-0055710-0056527 and i said look i'm really glad that hyun sook has a family to live with i was very worried about her i made a promise to her grandmother your mother
RickSmolan_2007P-0064697-0065402 daughter who the hell are you to accuse me of something like this and i said you know look i said
RickSmolan_2007P-0072933-0073091 father keene he's just a wonderful guy
RickSmolan_2007P-0087986-0088713 now we went out to dinner that night to celebrate the uncle went back to his family and natasha and tim and gene and i went out to dinner
RickSmolan_2007P-0099373-0100176 so i run over to gene and i wake him up and i say gene don't freak out i think the hotel's on fire and now there's smoke and flames coming by our windows we're on the eleventh floor
RickSmolan_2007P-0115460-0116850 and then twelve hours later we rented a car as we had planned to and drove back to natasha's village and we kept saying do you realize we were dying in a hotel fire like eight hours ago it's so weird how life just goes on natasha wanted to introduce her brother and father
RickSmolan_2007P-0130004-0130240 for the first time this is her cooking teacher
RickSmolan_2007P-0141201-0141497 and i always thought that was a very annie hall kind of outfit
RickWarren_2006-0004086-0005284 i think it's because spiritual emptiness is a universal disease i think inside at some point we put our heads down on the pillow and we go there's got to be more to life than this
RickWarren_2006-0012664-0013976 i've got to pretend that i'm more than i really am i think that comes down to this issue of meaning of significance of purpose i think it comes down to this issue of why am i here what am i here for
RickWarren_2006-0024409-0024721 now this is a worldview and i will tell you everybody's got a worldview
RickWarren_2006-0033720-0034917 you are a steward of it for instance that's why i believe in protecting the environment this is not my planet it wasn't mine before i was born it's not going to be mine after i die i'm just here for eighty years and
RickWarren_2006-0045749-0046884 it determines really everything in your life what we believe obviously and you know this determines our behavior and our behavior determines what we become in life
RickWarren_2006-0056267-0056435 and having been through literally
RickWarren_2006-0067959-0068809 giving your life away significance in life doesn't come from status because you can always find somebody who's got more than you
RickWarren_2006-0079498-0080393 care for the sick assist the poor speak up for the foreigner those in prison basically he's talking about all the marginalized in society
RickWarren_2006-0090399-0090533 moses says it's a staff
RickWarren_2006-0100609-0101985 in those days nobody had bank accounts or american express cards or hedge funds your assets are tied up in your flocks so it's a symbol of his identity and it's a symbol of his income and the third thing it's a symbol of his influence
RickWarren_2006-0106433-0107392 and so i'm talking to the players because most of the nba teams nfl teams and all the other teams have done this forty days of purpose based on the book
RickWarren_2006-0111054-0111597 that's the main reason i came up here today to all of you very bright people at ted
RickWarren_2006-0121144-0121844 some people have the misguided idea that god only gets excited when you're doing quote spiritual things like going to church or
RitaPierson_2013S-0010550-0011118 well i said to her you know kids don't learn from people they don't like
Rives4AM_2007-0010090-0010898 a time for even grimmer stuff than that like in last april's new yorker magazine this short fiction piece by martin amis starts
Rives4AM_2007-0024996-0025243 but he didn't die on dench's birthday he languished
Rives4AM_2007-0033535-0034282 wait wait wait wait wait let me see if i got this straight it is christmas day four a m there's a rumble in my stomach homer
Rives4AM_2007-0047008-0047631 remind us as he does in the wrap up to his fine autobiography that on this day bill clinton began a journey
RivesINTERNET_2006S-0006994-0007868 but i still stretch miles in all directions if i owned the internet napster monster and friendster com would be one big
RivesINTERNET_2006S-0019410-0020738 i think a modern day miracle oracle can get but ooh eee you want to bet just how whack and un pc your mac or pc is going to be when i'm rocking hot shit hot shot god net i guess it's just like
RivesMOCKINGBIRD_2006-0012288-0013278 where in the world is this world heading on one end gold bars on the other an entire planet we are twelve billion light years from the edge that's
RivesMOCKINGBIRD_2006-0020663-0021815 and then come the news crews and the man in the street interviews letters to the editor everybody asking just who is responsible for this citywide nationwide mockingbird cacophony and somebody finally is going to tip the city council of monterey california
RivesTTYL_2008-0009985-0010201 you walk like a waltz
Rives_2012S-0001577-0003322 last month the encyclopaedia britannica announced that it is going out of print after two hundred and forty four years which made me nostalgic because i remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library back when i was a kid maybe twelve years old
Rives_2012S-0016141-0016350 chimborazo so
Rives_2012S-0034449-0034624 sympathetic magic
Rives_2012S-0046741-0047684 and more specifically his skeleton wound up in the smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles in between those two landmarks in ham's life
Rives_2012S-0051651-0052741 would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule on the tip of a rocket who volunteered to be launched into outer space the first one of any of us to
Rives_2012S-0055827-0056234 you can click on one more link you can come back to earth
Rives_4AM_2007-0008338-0008720 in the morning laughter a time for even grimmer stuff
Rives_4AM_2007-0025233-0026151 until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed to a supposedly self inflicted gunshot wound at the age of sixty four which incidentally
Rives_IfIControlledtheInternet_2006S-0003183-0003564 if i controlled the internet
Rives_Mockingbird_2006-0015506-0016916 per job it's a very strange world inside a nanotube women can talk black men ski white men build strong buildings we build strong suns the surface of the earth is absolutely riddled with holes and here we are
Rives_TTYL_2008-0013633-0013937 first soon and then
RobDunbar_2010Z-0008974-0009643 and by this weird quirk of alphabetical order of the nations a lot of the low lying states like
RobDunbar_2010Z-0028410-0029585 like one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future is to drill down in time to the last period where we had co two double what it is today and so that's what we've done with this ship this was
RobDunbar_2010Z-0042152-0042677 between sediments that look like this there's gravel and cobbles in there and a bunch of sand
RobDunbar_2010Z-0054036-0054840 this is a serious consequence for nations like kiribati you know where the average elevation is about a little over a meter above sea level
RobDunbar_2010Z-0075016-0076291 then after we harvest a coral we measure this ratio and now you can see those curves match perfectly in this case at these islands you know corals are instrumental quality recorders of change in the water
RobDunbar_2010Z-0086196-0087055 but then at the very end is where we have the instrumental record in black and there's the temperature up there in two thousand and nine you know we've warmed the globe
RobDunbar_2010Z-0099264-0100661 greater metabolic demands reduced reproductive success changes in respiration and metabolism you know these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transience so
RobForbes_2006-0005868-0006618 stuff that was available to all people and stuff that probably contains some other important messages i'll use these sidewalks in rio as an example
RobForbes_2006-0021435-0022918 you wouldn't look at this and call this a designer bike a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum but i began looking at design in a place like amsterdam and recognized you know the first job of design is to serve a social purpose and so i look at this bike as not being
RobForbes_2006-0038171-0038930 red drew me into this little composition optimistic to me in the sense that maybe the public service's mailbox door service
RobForbes_2006-0045264-0046138 nice little piece of sculpture so there's this sort of silent hand of design at work that i see in places that i go havana is a wonderful area
RobForbes_2006-0052104-0052875 so innovative and so tolerant the past and the present work quite well together in italy also and i think that
RobForbes_2006-0067609-0068245 spain having lunch one of those nice days where you had the place kind of to yourself and you have a glass of wine and
RobForbes_2006-0079749-0080588 are our contributions to a larger whole cities are the place where we're most likely to encounter diversity
RobForbes_2006-0091815-0092623 both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the u s can really take a leadership role and chicago is one example thank you very much
RobHarmon_2010X-0019021-0020525 it's a broken system there's a disincentive to conserve because if you don't use your water right you can lose your water right and i'm sure you all know this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities
RobHarmon_2010X-0037310-0038709 and is closing this water diversion leaving the water in the stream he doesn't lose the water right he just chooses to apply that right or some portion of it to the stream instead of to the land
RobHarmon_2010X-0050883-0051690 we can and we do turn this into this
RobHopkins_2009G-0015234-0015951 yet when we take a step back and look over the span of history at what we might call the petroleum interval
RobHopkins_2009G-0038239-0039488 we have the magic porridge pot in the form of walmart and tesco and we have the elves in the form of china but we don't appreciate what an astonishing thing that has been
RobHopkins_2009G-0053039-0054412 it's self organizing there is no great central organization that pushes this people just pick up an idea and they run with it and they implement it where they are it's solutions focused it's very much looking at what people can do where they are to respond to this
RobHopkins_2009G-0066048-0067013 they start to run an awareness raising program looking at how this might actually work in the town they show films they give talks and so on it's a process which is playful and creative
RobHopkins_2009G-0082858-0083737 getting a lot of interest from government ed miliband the energy minister of this country was invited to come our recent conference as a keynote listener which
RobLegato_2012G-0003353-0004061 and as an experiment because i dauntingly create a task for myself of recreating a saturn v launch
RobLegato_2012G-0024582-0025789 i don't know why but they thought they did so we were he's a hero he's an astronaut and we're all sort of excited and you know i gave myself the liberty of saying you know some of the shots i did
RobLegato_2012G-0048017-0048311 basically in all its glory and conversely i wanted to see it
RobLegato_2012G-0060329-0060920 basically magically transplant from one state of the titanic to the other so i'll just play the shot once
RobLegato_2012G-0070743-0071941 we sasha baron cohen is a very clever very smart guy comedian wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of the buster keaton sort of slapstick things and he wanted his leg brace to get caught on a moving train
RobLegato_2012G-0079157-0079568 the thing without the wheels that moves precisely
RobReid_2012-0012091-0012443 so this small missing chunk here is puzzling
RobertBallard_2008-0007956-0008518 or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark gloomy place that has nothing to offer
RobertBallard_2008-0019267-0020137 it's amazing all right so we're going to immerse ourselves in the seventy two percent of the planet because you know it's really naive to think that the easter bunny
RobertBallard_2008-0034748-0035381 and our interest in this mountain range as earth scientists in those days was not only because of its tremendous size dominating the planet
RobertBallard_2008-0046996-0047876 we understood mountains under compression but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension it should not be until one of my colleagues said it looks to me like a thermal blister
RobertBallard_2008-0062109-0063376 on a forty two thousand mile mountain range great job security but not the way to go so i began designing a new technology of telepresence using robotic systems to replicate myself so i wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system
RobertBallard_2008-0074269-0075643 instead of belching out lava they were belching out big big bubbles of methane and they were creating these volcanoes and there were flows not of lava but of the mud coming out of the earth but driven by i've never seen this before
RobertBallard_2008-0089666-0090576 an ancient shipwreck a phoenician off brazil or a new rock formation a new life so we're going to run it like an emergency hospital we're going to connect our command center
RobertBallard_2008-0102588-0102956 because this is what we want this is what we want
RobertFischell_2005-0004976-0005717 an emergency room and people with silent ischemia which translated into english means they don't have any symptoms
RobertFischell_2005-0016961-0017856 that will trigger an emergency alarm vibration like your cell phone but right by your clavicle bone and when it goes beep beep beep
RobertFischell_2005-0028681-0029452 he kept the balloon filled to block the artery to simulate a blockage which is what a heart attack is and it's not hard to see that
RobertFischell_2005-0039743-0040678 so we said well we're experts in stents tonight you'll see some of our invented stents we said so we'll put in a stent but we're not going to put in a stent that we'd put in people
RobertFischell_2005-0053578-0054990 finally you go to the emergency room you wait as burns and other critical patients are treated because seventy five percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains don't have ami so you're not taken very seriously
RobertFischell_2005-0069542-0070435 know there's a certain faraday's law which says if i apply a magnetic pulse on salt water that's your brains by the way
RobertFischell_2005-0075845-0076827 has a wire about an inch in diameter and here's one of the patients who has an aura and always has a headache bad one after the aura what do we do
RobertFischell_2005-0081698-0082547 we designed a magnetic depolarizer that looks like this that you could have a lady in her pocket book and when you get an aura you can try it
RobertFischell_2005-0094955-0096308 get treated and get diminished and auras can be erased and the migraine then does not occur and that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on
RobertFischell_2005-0107859-0108728 and uses a dental burr to remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device and tonight you'll be able to see the device in the tent
RobertFischell_2005-0119581-0120714 i have three wishes well i can't do much about africa i'm a tech i'm into medical gadgetry which is mostly high tech stuff like mister bono talked about
RobertFischell_2005-0134560-0135529 the second wish is at the present time the clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators that's what tms means
RobertFischell_2005-0150067-0151292 that's the present system how about making a video we have entertainment people here we have people who know how to do videos with visual presentation of the anatomy and procedure done with animation everybody knows
RobertFull_2002-0008793-0009654 many biologists will tell engineers and others organisms have millions of years to get it right they're spectacular they can do everything wonderfully well
RobertFull_2002-0024960-0025923 works like two legs of a trotting dog or works like three legs together as one of a trotting insect or four legs as one as a trotting crab and then they alternate
RobertFull_2002-0031489-0032355 and we were able to create a model where animals are not only bouncing up and down but they're also bouncing side to side at the same time and many organisms fit
RobertFull_2002-0042245-0043570 here's one example that's really exciting this is a collaboration we have with stanford and they developed this new technique called shape deposition manufacturing it's a technique where they can mix materials together and mold any shape that they like and
RobertFull_2002-0059395-0059815 now what's important about this robot compared to other robots
RobertFull_2002-0070960-0071199 the fundamental dynamics
RobertFull_2002-0081485-0081700 it's just phenomenal
RobertFull_2002-0093843-0094663 peeling in the mecho gecko that allows them climb autonomously can go on the flat surface transition to a wall and then go on to a ceiling there's the bulldozer version
RobertFull_2002-0109483-0110144 what we're doing is we're taking that inspiration of the hairs and with another colleague at berkeley
RobertFull_2005-0002520-0002888 you to help me create a fully three d dynamic parameterized contact model
RobertFull_2005-0023346-0024187 it turns out that animals can go anywhere they can locomote on substrates that vary as you saw in the probability of contact the movement of that surface
RobertFull_2005-0029345-0029667 passing some cockroaches around take a look at their feet
RobertFull_2005-0034115-0034300 that's a bipedal octopus
RobertFull_2005-0039876-0040761 but we know that art imitates life and it turns out nature three million years ago evolved the next animal it's a shrimp like animal called the stomatopod and here's how it moves on the beaches of
RobertFull_2005-0054026-0054396 a problem with this kind of mesh because they don't have spines
RobertFull_2005-0064402-0065299 the animal effectively climbs by slipping and look and doing actually terribly with respect to grabbing on the surface it looks in fact like it's swimming up the surface
RobertFull_2005-0077796-0078046 it just extrudes and this was a hard shot to get i think this is
RobertFull_2005-0087163-0087374 so to our blueprint we split some hairs
RobertFull_2005-0097328-0097489 i call the new robot rise
RobertFull_2005-0110209-0110624 but more to come later to finish we've gotten design secrets from nature by looking at how
RobertFull_2009-0008597-0009314 that look like a rug and each of those hairs has the worst case of split ends possible about one hundred to one thousand split ends that are nano size
RobertFull_2009-0020115-0021241 as they run up the wall well i'm really excited today to show you the newest version of a robot stickybot using a new hierarchical dry adhesive here is the actual robot
RobertFull_2009-0030368-0031197 for example we know that you can grab onto things with them and perhaps it is most well known that they provide static balance
RobertFull_2009-0043248-0043777 and what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf and there was some wind or we
RobertFull_2009-0053520-0053765 it does an equilibrium glide
RobertFull_2009-0065579-0066232 so now we can continue this mutualism by suggesting that they can make an active tail
RobertGordon_2013-0009172-0009865 powerful invents less great wonderful things then growth is going to be even lower than half of history
RobertGordon_2013-0023118-0024854 and the reason is the headwinds the first headwind is demographics it's a truism that your standard of living rises faster than productivity rises faster than output per hour if hours per person increased and we got that gift back in the seventy s and eighty s when women entered the labor force
RobertGordon_2013-0029837-0030232 economy grew from two thousand to two thousand and seven
RobertGordon_2013-0037022-0038913 if you wanted to read in one thousand eight hundred and seventy five at night you needed to have an oil or a gas lamp they created pollution they created odors they were hard to control the light was dim and they were a fire hazard by one thousand nine hundred and twenty nine electric light was everywhere
RobertGordon_2013-0051290-0052107 the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households in the united states reached ninety percent in just thirty years
RobertGordon_2013-0068415-0070152 the problem we face is that all these great inventions we have to match them in the future and my prediction that we're not going to match them brings us down from the original two percent growth down to zero point two the fanciful curve that i drew you at the beginning
RobertGupta_2012P-0023190-0024794 seeing this video of gabby giffords reminded me of the work of dr gottfried schlaug one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at harvard and schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called melodic intonation therapy which has become very popular in music therapy now
RobertGupta_2012P-0038700-0039364 and it turned out that gottfried schlaug had studied as an organist at the vienna conservatory but had given up his love
RobertGupta_2012P-0051311-0053274 playing for nathaniel the music took on a deeper meaning because now it was about communication a communication where words failed a communication of a message that went deeper than words that registered at a fundamentally primal level in nathaniel's psyche yet came as a true musical offering from me
RobertGupta_2012P-0069542-0069954 music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone
RobertHammond_2011U-0005192-0005873 and by one thousand nine hundred and eighty the last train rode it was a train loaded with frozen turkeys they say at thanksgiving from the meatpacking district
RobertHammond_2011U-0020504-0021281 it's been successful beyond our dreams last year we had about two million people which is about ten times what we ever estimated
RobertLang_2008-0005193-0006023 called a crane every japanese kid learns how to fold that crane so this art has been around for hundreds of years and you would think something
RobertLang_2008-0018757-0019762 you look at the angles around the fold you find that if you number the angles in a circle all the even numbered angles add up to a straight line all the odd numbered angles add up to a straight line
RobertLang_2008-0029373-0030654 what matters is what we mean by those symbols and you might say can you really be that specific i mean a stag beetle it's got two points for jaws it's got antennae can you be that specific in the detail and yeah you really can
RobertLang_2008-0043917-0044114 and here's where the dead people start to help
RobertLang_2008-0054212-0055000 things with legs and antennae and if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square wasn't interesting enough then you could do
RobertLang_2008-0069960-0071029 now there is actually a little origami in the james webb space telescope but it's very simple the telescope going up in space it unfolds in two places it folds in thirds
RobertLang_2008-0082340-0083676 the problem that's being solved here is something that needs to be big and sheet like at its destination but needs to be small for the journey and that works whether you're going into space or whether you're just going into a body
RobertLang_2008-0089158-0089525 and that leads to a really interesting idea
RobertLang_2008-0093280-0093678 turn around and turn out to have an application in the real world
RobertNeuwirth_2005-0011610-0012355 but i'm a journalist and we exaggerate so almost one point five million people a week close to seventy million people a year
RobertNeuwirth_2005-0026267-0027177 his roommate hilary kibagendi onsomu who was cooking ugali the spongy white cornmeal concoction that is the staple food in the country cut into the conversation
RobertNeuwirth_2005-0042373-0043513 in rio de janeiro and it's getting a bit better right we're seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs and plaster over the brick some color
RobertNeuwirth_2005-0060303-0061313 and what hotel means in kenya and india is an eating place so that's a restaurant people steal electrical power this is rio
RobertNeuwirth_2005-0077025-0077828 this woman is nine which means grandma in turkish and there were three old ladies who lived in that's her self built house behind her and
RobertNeuwirth_2005G-0008034-0009535 and at certain points we were walking around he grabbed my hand for support which is something most kenyans would never consider doing they're very polite and they don't get so forward so quickly and i found out later that it was julius first
RobertNeuwirth_2005G-0019416-0020642 so the hut was made of corrugated metal set on a concrete pad it was a ten by ten cell armstrong o'brian jr shared it with three other men
RobertNeuwirth_2005G-0034232-0035100 when twenty families one hundred people or so share a single latrine a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing
RobertNeuwirth_2005G-0047110-0048049 and someone else builds on top of their building and then that person sells the roof rights and someone else builds on top of their building all of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick
RobertNeuwirth_2005G-0058080-0059638 this is a shopping street in kibera and you can see that there's a soda dealer a health clinic two beauty salons a bar two grocery stores and a church and more it's a typical downtown street
RobertNeuwirth_2005G-0070176-0070450 and they need access to politics
RobertNeuwirth_2012G-0001970-0002436 and what i mean by that is that this is a photograph i took in makoko
RobertNeuwirth_2012G-0015833-0016758 and the former french colonies have turned that into system d for the economy of self reliance or the diy economy
RobertNeuwirth_2012G-0036329-0036925 wal mart buys fifteen percent thus fifteen percent of procter gamble's business is with wal mart
RobertNeuwirth_2012G-0053337-0053874 you can buy fake designer glasses you can buy cloned cologne
RobertNeuwirth_2012G-0062419-0064311 but also that we're blaming the little guy who doesn't pay his taxes and we're not recognizing that everyone's fudging things all over the world including some extremely respected businesses and i'll give you one example there was one company that paid four thousand bribes in the first decade of this millennium
RobertNeuwirth_2012G-0071013-0071715 and third is and i'm taking this from the great american beat poet allen ginsberg that
RobertThurman_2009P-0009310-0010050 this is perfect in that it clearly opposes self centeredness and selfishness to compassion the concern for others
RobertThurman_2009P-0021213-0021995 and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today so he went on this retreat
RobertThurman_2009P-0032796-0033652 and some of it is like gangrenous and there's like maggots in the flesh and it's terrible he thinks what can i do to fix up this dog
RobertThurman_2009P-0047489-0047767 a globe a ball took him on his shoulder
RobertThurman_2009P-0057707-0058519 so in a way i like them so much because they're nice to me while the neutral ones i don't know they could all be just fine and then
RobertThurman_2009P-0071723-0072891 mama cheney as my mom when of course i was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in iraq i used to meditate on george bush he's quite a cute mom in a female form has his little ears and he
RobertThurman_2009P-0085763-0086857 anyway that's the lovely love and then finally the fifth step is compassion universal compassion and that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of
RobertThurman_2009P-0092723-0093485 in the town and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots and i'm sure he did that later but that
RobertThurman_2009P-0099642-0100924 means universal responsibility and that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us that we are responsible for that and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it
RobertWright_2006-0004569-0004998 when i was asked to give this upbeat talk that even as i was giving the upbeat talk
RobertWright_2006-0014618-0015357 and amazingly that evolution sustains the trajectory that biological evolution had established toward greater complexity
RobertWright_2006-0030536-0031964 assuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading very quickly the key idea is the distinction between zero sum games in which correlations are inverse always a winner and a loser non zero sum games in which correlations
RobertWright_2006-0043639-0044445 to more win win outcomes than lose lose outcomes on balance i think history is a net positive in the non zero sum game department
RobertWright_2006-0060097-0061252 now back to the unfolding apocalypse and you may wonder ok that's all fine sounds great moral direction in history but what about this so called clash of civilizations well
RobertWright_2006-0074148-0074273 we do well
RobertWright_2006-0084423-0085096 and drive home the positive correlation and people do what's in their self interests which is further the moral evolution
RobertWright_2006-0091466-0092340 doing things you consider strange in a culture you consider strange to really understand why they do the things they do is a morally redeeming
RobertWright_2006-0100320-0100990 is part of an effort to get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run i think it's the first step toward that that's the long term goal
RobertWright_2006-0109894-0110776 the christian usage that we're familiar with saving souls that people go to heaven that's actually a latecomer the original meaning of the word salvation in the bible
RobertWright_2009P-0016126-0016880 get there i hope to get a little fuzzier to me this isn't this doesn't bother me so much that the underlying darwinian rationale of compassion
RobertWright_2009P-0030830-0031876 so they do understand that if you want to be treated well you treat other people well and it's good to treat other people well that's close to being
RobertWright_2009P-0049352-0050273 basically a zero sum game is the kind you're used to in sports where there's a winner and a loser so their fortunes add up to zero okay so in tennis
RobertWright_2009P-0066284-0067370 you see this all the time in the modern world you saw it with the recent economic crash where bad things happen in the economy bad for everybody for much of the world good things happen it's good for
RobertWright_2009P-0081088-0082227 for whether they are in a zero sum or a non zero sum relationship with a nation like say america or any other nation human psychology is such that they use cues like do we feel we're being respected
RobertWright_2009P-0097272-0097997 that in so many ways they're in the same boat i would just sum up the way things look at least from this secular perspective
RobertoDAngelo_2013G-0020799-0022233 and we showed him how to grab the object now the theory of mirror neurons simply says that in your brains exactly now as you watch me doing this you are activating exactly the same neurons as if you do
RobinChase_2007-0003534-0003965 generate a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce c two in the other sectors
RobinChase_2007-0009650-0010495 ways that we can make some dramatic changes so zipcar is a company that i founded seven years ago but it's an example of something called carsharing
RobinChase_2007-0022533-0023503 that it was completely trivial that it takes thirty seconds to rent to reserve a car go get it drive it and for me as a service provider i would never be able to provide you a car for an hour
RobinChase_2007-0035597-0035733 ken livingston was reelected
RobinChase_2007-0049542-0049646 yes i am
RobinChase_2007-0063242-0063455 so you know when you stick this idea
RobinChase_2007-0074206-0075045 and if i had my druthers we would have an open source version in addition to open standards and this open source version means that
RobinChase_2012G-0003510-0003849 and each driver drives about eighty percent less
RobinChase_2012G-0009870-0010199 fairs are the same thing as etsy
RobinChase_2012G-0018740-0019605 and i'll talk about that later so we have the peers that are providing the services and the product and the company that's doing the stuff that companies do
RobinChase_2012G-0030362-0031001 building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do i think of the difference
RobinChase_2012G-0048153-0048452 but what does peer production do peer production
RobinChase_2012G-0065583-0067372 and for me when i think about our future and all of those problems that seem incredibly large the scale is impossible the urgency is there peers inc provides the speed and scale and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems
RobinInce_2011G-0017603-0019074 you've not really made that decision but in fact every single permutation of those decisions is made each one going off into a new universe that is a wonderful idea if you ever think that your life is rubbish
RobinInce_2011G-0033679-0034222 now i know you don't think that you may well have your own children and think oh no my child's best
RodneyBrooks_2003-0007665-0008436 other games that came after that and we're starting to see that same sort of thing with robots lego mindstorms furbies who here did anyone here have
RodneyBrooks_2003-0021626-0022098 the three year old kids they don't worry about it it's grown ups that get really
RodneyBrooks_2003-0034149-0035186 to go upstairs and it does that was not a controlled descent now
RodneyBrooks_2003-0050145-0051516 so now i brought this up in front of him i'd looked at his eyes and i saw his eyes looked at this bottle top and i'm doing this task here and he's checking up his eyes are going back and forth up to me to see what i'm looking at so we've got shared attention
RodneyBrooks_2003-0064704-0065402 this is a habituation gaussian that gets negative and more and more intense as it looks at one thing and it gets bored
RodneyBrooks_2003-0082159-0083147 raise our eyebrows move our eyes give the other person the idea it's their turn to talk and then they talk and then we pass the baton back and forth between each
RodneyBrooks_2003-0097648-0098455 it's all mechanistic we are mechanism if we are machines then in principle at least we should be able to build machines
RodneyBrooks_2013-0003560-0005330 whether we're going to get the technology we need in the long term because the demographics are really going to leave us with lots of jobs that need doing and that we our society is going to have to be built on the shoulders of steel of robots in the future so i'm scared we won't have enough robots
RodneyBrooks_2013-0022655-0024114 in order to program them you have to understand six dimensional vectors and quaternions and ordinary people can't interact with them and i think it's the sort of technology that's gone wrong it's displaced the worker from the technology
RodneyBrooks_2013-0036570-0037781 the object from it just moves it around and the robot figures out that was an area search he didn't have to select that from a menu and now he's going to go off and train the visual appearance of that object while we continue talking
RodneyBrooks_2013-0044282-0045556 and so our vision is that mildred who's the line worker becomes mildred the robot trainer she lifts her game like the office workers of the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s lifted their game of what they could do
RodneyMullen_2012X-0011264-0011565 pictures in the magazines that a couple other guys skate
RodneyMullen_2012X-0027410-0029202 so as humbling and rotten as it was and believe me it was rotten i would go to skate spots and i was already like famous guy right and everyone thought i was good but in this new terrain i was horrible so people would go oh he's all oh what happened to mullen
RodneyMullen_2012X-0065102-0065283 so next oh mind you
RodneyMullen_2012X-0080805-0081342 make it better give it back so we all rise further very similar communities very similar
RodneyMullen_2012X-0107394-0107858 and so that's what i proceeded to do through a long story one of desperation
RogerEbert_2011-0016700-0017410 suddenly i had an episode of catastrophic bleeding my carotid artery had ruptured
RogerEbert_2011-0024889-0025137 within the sound chamber of our mouth
RogerEbert_2011-0034137-0034683 but what value do we place on the sound of our own voice how does that affect who you are as a person
RogerEbert_2011-0053511-0053987 and now i still can
RogerEbert_2011-0063891-0064369 that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world i had a flashback
RogerEbert_2011-0079077-0079433 it is unimaginable what will happen next
RogerEbert_2011-0090789-0092162 while harvesting tissue from both my shoulders the surgeries left me with back pain and reduced my ability to walk easily ironic that my legs are fine and it's my shoulders that slow up my walk
RogerEbert_2011-0106006-0106363 i am writing as well as ever i am productive
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X-0012851-0013847 and he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky and where you can experience the sun that give us a better life in the built environment
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X-0024803-0025432 and enjoying the sun can be in many different ways of course it can be just like this
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X-0030506-0030786 it has only on one side
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X-0039181-0039945 to me it is something from theatre and i will get back to that a little bit later it's the spotlight on the artist that helps you to focus
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X-0050489-0050990 it's a little bit of a different story this health aspect of light than what i'm telling you today
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X-0062254-0062751 into the sky and never reaches the ground because if we look at the earth
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X-0072467-0074066 so you would not to be able to really see them so i asked our laboratory to do something about it and they said well we can do something they created for me the biggest led in the world especially for tedx in amsterdam so here it is it's the same thing as you can see over there
RogierVanDerHeide_2010X-0087919-0089286 when i see it i start to think who are those people where have they come from where are they going what just happened what will be happening in the next five minutes and it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light
RomulusWhitaker_2009I-0004773-0005451 and i know we've all seen images enough to make us numb of the tragedies that we're perpetrating on the planet
RomulusWhitaker_2009I-0020729-0021682 and it brought me straight into the conservation fray i ended up starting this research and education station in agumbe which you are all of course invited to visit
RomulusWhitaker_2009I-0037895-0038713 well the king cobra is literally a keystone species in these rainforests and our job is to convince the authorities
RomulusWhitaker_2009I-0044770-0045888 it pours out millions of gallons every hour and supplies drinking water to at least three hundred million people and washes many many babies and of course
RomulusWhitaker_2009I-0053292-0054686 in fact if you see the map the range of their original habitat was all the way from the indus in pakistan to the irrawaddy in burma and now it's just limited to a couple of spots in nepal and india so
RomulusWhitaker_2009I-0067928-0068903 all their organs and tried to figure out what was going on and it came down to something called gout which as a result of kidney breakdown is actually uric acid crystals
RomulusWhitaker_2009I-0080076-0081043 if they don't drown in the net then they simply cut their beaks off animals like the ganges river dolphin which is just down to a few left and it is also critically endangered so who is next us
RomulusWhitaker_2009I-0095407-0096478 i take the sort of humble approach i guess you could say i don't say that snakes are huggable exactly it's not like the teddy bear but i
RonEglash_2007G-0011552-0012353 this made no sense at all so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books they said these are pathological curves and we don't have to discuss them
RonEglash_2007G-0034852-0035495 so when i got to the village i said can you take me to the square building i think something's going on there and they said
RonEglash_2007G-0053042-0054477 in angola the chokwe people draw lines in the sand and it's what the german mathematician euler called a graph we now call it an eulerian path you can never lift your stylus from the surface and you can never go over the same line twice
RonEglash_2007G-0068935-0069248 and they did this very rapidly
RonEglash_2007G-0076645-0077608 and then you take this symbol and you put it back in so it's a self generating diversity of symbols they're truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this
RonEglash_2007G-0088417-0089071 with children using this software in a mathematics class in comparison with a control group that did not have the software
RonEglash_2007G2-0002972-0003853 and take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process a recursive process so he starts out with one line and then two and then four and then sixteen and so on
RonEglash_2007G2-0017001-0017628 and i'll show you a little natural recursion here again we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape
RonEglash_2007G2-0030033-0030850 now you might wonder how can people fit in a tiny village only this big that's because they're spirit people it's the ancestors and of course the spirit people
RonEglash_2007G2-0045795-0046460 second you might ask well doctor eglash aren't you ignoring the diversity of african cultures and three times the answer is no
RonEglash_2007G2-0063565-0064673 that the farther up from the ground you go the stronger the wind blows right it's just like a cost benefit analysis and i measured out the lengths of straw put it on a log log plot got the scaling exponent
RonEglash_2007G2-0083846-0084704 started in africa and i know brian eno says there's not enough africa in computers you know i don't think there's enough african history in
RonFinley_2013-0005158-0005726 just like twenty six point five million other americans i live in a food desert
RonFinley_2013-0030336-0030502 just like a graffiti artist
RonFinley_2013-0043483-0043645 it was cool
RonGutman_2011U-0003497-0004549 when i grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers i decided instead to embark on a journey of real science to find a more useful truth
RonGutman_2011U-0022192-0023082 you ask why because smiling is evolutionarily contagious and it suppresses the control we usually have on our facial muscles
RonMcCallum_2013X-0006451-0006663 some sixty four years ago
RonMcCallum_2013X-0022028-0022224 and i could then read it back
RonMcCallum_2013X-0048578-0048898 i no longer would be censored for example
RonMcCallum_2013X-0063682-0064279 i grew up with family friends reading to me and i loved the warmth
RonMcCallum_2013X-0075388-0075574 or read for we blind persons
RonMcCallum_2013X-0079020-0080555 well because we can't transport books across borders there had to be separate versions read in all the different english speaking countries britain united states canada australia and new zealand all had to have separate readings of harry potter
RonMcCallum_2013X-0089784-0091156 i'd like to thank my researcher hannah martin who is my slide clicker who clicks the slides and my wife professor mary crock who's the light of my life is coming on to collect me i want to thank her too
RonnyEdry_2012X-0025906-0027107 to come graphic designers most of them to make posters with me because i didn't have the time it was a huge amount of pictures so for a few days that's how my living room was
RonnyEdry_2012X-0046891-0048320 the moment i really understood that something was happening a friend of mine told me google the word israel and those were the first images on those days that popped up from google
RonnyEdry_2012X-0065466-0067074 to come to israel and she gets on the plane and arrives at ben gurion and says okay not that big a deal so a few weeks ago the stress is getting higher
RonnyEdry_2012X-0081497-0083055 sometimes but maybe with effort we can avoid it maybe as people because especially in israel we're in a democracy we have the freedom of speech and maybe that little thing can change something
RoryBremner_2009G-0006783-0007467 so this morning i thought oh well i'll just do a card trick that one's gone as well
RoryBremner_2009G-0015894-0016262 a whole new experience don't you think i mean he must walk in and they will say
RoryBremner_2009G-0029480-0029699 british jobs for scottish people
RoryBremner_2009G-0041189-0041804 asking for your bank details and you know iceland it was never going to cut it it didn't have that kind of
RoryBremner_2009G-0050280-0051021 as we can clearly see no seismic occurrence is about to overwhelm the u s economy now there is a man on top of his job
RoryBremner_2009G-0063246-0063427 who still doubts
RoryBremner_2009G-0077859-0078503 this world a better place if you can i just think that's important i really do and i was
RoryStewart_2011G-0002252-0002784 why are we still in afghanistan one decade later
RoryStewart_2011G-0015612-0016322 when president obama signed off on a surge that we finally had in the words of secretary clinton
RoryStewart_2011G-0027702-0027922 lucky to be able to look at the koran
RoryStewart_2011G-0038118-0038952 considerably more islamist than we'd like to acknowledge this man for example mullah mustafa tried to shoot me
RoryStewart_2011G-0043708-0045017 two thousand and five anthony fitzherbert an agricultural engineer could travel through helmand could stay in nad ali sangin and ghoresh which are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place today he could never do that
RoryStewart_2011G-0053204-0054030 i have the right resources and the correct strategy which will deliver in general barno's word in two thousand and four the decisive year
RoryStewart_2011G-0067856-0068058 the missing component of this
RoryStewart_2011G-0076034-0076678 so we need to change that institutional culture and i could make the same points about the united states and the united nations
RoryStewart_2011G-0089196-0089371 was our humility
RoryStewart_2011G-0099517-0100448 but the amount of preparation you can do is limited you can take some water you can have a map you can have a pack but what really matters
RoryStewart_2011G-0114253-0114927 or total isolation and we are always being tempted up to our neck we put our toes in and we go up to our neck
RoryStewart_2012X-0004983-0005285 that his father is a politician
RoryStewart_2012X-0016527-0017129 a dismal depressing landscape of burnt and half abandoned buildings
RoryStewart_2012X-0029183-0030960 again you can see democracy and elections are compatible with corrupt governments with states that are unstable and dangerous and when i have conversations with people i remember having a conversation for example in iraq with a community that asked me
RoryStewart_2012X-0041422-0042525 there is a sunni sheikh there's a shiite sheikh there's the seven leaders of the seven major tribes there's a christian there's a sabian there are female representatives there's every political
RoryStewart_2012X-0051812-0052358 why should we get away from those arguments because they're very dangerous if we set about saying for example
RoryStewart_2012X-0067402-0067700 or perhaps that we feel we should not deliver
RoryStewart_2012X-0077689-0079117 and the media which mediates between the politicians and the public needs to allow those politicians to be honest if local democracy is to flourish it is about the active and informed engagement of every citizen
RorySutherland_2009G-0011268-0012154 what you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male and female supermodels pay them to walk the length of the train handing out free chateau petrus for the entire duration of the
RorySutherland_2009G-0035840-0036608 better than compulsion these funny signs that flash your speed at you some of the new ones on the bottom right now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face
RorySutherland_2009G-0049657-0050714 in terms of dress denim is perhaps the perfect example of something which replaces material value with symbolic value coca cola a bunch of you may be a load of pinkos and you may not like the coca cola company
RorySutherland_2009G-0057913-0058649 this is actually called a mash up where you take content that someone else has produced and you do something new with it in the world of food we call it cooking
RorySutherland_2009G-0081379-0081597 you see that when you see the diamond
RorySutherland_2010S-0001657-0003155 you who may remember me from tedglobal remember me asking a few questions which still preoccupy me one of them was why is it necessary to spend six billion pounds speeding up the eurostar train when for a about ten percent of that money you could have top supermodels male and female
RorySutherland_2010S-0018655-0018715 now
RorySutherland_2010S-0037523-0038431 highly intelligent attention and they're great and terminal five is absolutely magnificent until you get down to the small detail the usability which is the signage
RorySutherland_2010S-0054613-0055597 if the board of directors convince everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors it makes the disparity in salaries
RorySutherland_2010S-0066922-0067716 so what accenture suddenly found so unattractive about that i'm not sure then there are other things that don't cost much and achieve absolutely nothing that's called trivia
RorySutherland_2011X-0009393-0010637 cannot be overstated what we have is exactly the same thing the same activity but one of them makes you feel great and the other one with just a small change of posture
RorySutherland_2011X-0026158-0026336 what costs us ten pounds
RorySutherland_2011X-0037101-0038478 in looking at solutions we've probably given too much priority to what i call technical engineering solutions newtonian solutions and not nearly enough to the psychological ones you know my example of the eurostar
RorySutherland_2011X-0057565-0059472 and you should seek as far as possible to find solutions which sit in the sweet spot in the middle if you actually look at a great business you'll nearly always see all of these three things coming into play really really successful businesses google is great great technological success but it's also based on a very good psychological insight
RorySutherland_2011X-0073642-0075485 because they think you're deliberately creating delays at the bridge in order to maximize your revenue and why on earth should i pay to subsidize your imcompetence on the other hand change the frame slightly and create charitable yield management so the extra money you get goes not to the bridge company it goes to charity
RorySutherland_2011X-0093568-0094608 try this quick thought experiment imagine a restaurant that serves michelin starred food but actually where the restaurant smells of sewage and there's human feces on the floor
RoseGeorge_2013-0003543-0004279 and for some reason that day instead i asked myself a question and it was where does this stuff
RoseGeorge_2013-0017981-0018556 in what i call the flushed and plumbed world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in
RoseGeorge_2013-0026441-0028218 and the cost to the world is immense two hundred and sixty billion dollars lost every year on the losses to poor sanitation these are cholera beds in haiti you'll have heard of cholera but we don't hear about diarrhea it gets a fraction of the attention and funding given to any of those other diseases
RoseGeorge_2013-0034682-0035026 you'll think there's something wrong with the math because
RoseGeorge_2013-0041563-0042274 they've been used to sitting through lessons for years and years holding it in we've all done that but they do it every day
RoseGeorge_2013-0059539-0061391 they tried selling soap as healthy no one bought it they tried selling it as sexy everyone bought it in india now there's a campaign which persuades young brides not to marry into families that don't have a toilet it's called no loo no i do
RoseGeorge_2013-0079329-0079804 i hope that we can do that it's not a difficult thing to do
RossLovegrove_2005-0002270-0003052 so there's a terribly weird freaky side to me which i'm fighting with all the time so to try and
RossLovegrove_2005-0014475-0015269 a drawing by leonardo da vinci five hundred years ago before photography it shows how observation curiosity
RossLovegrove_2005-0029838-0030545 this special interest in things like this which blow my mind i don't know whether to you know drop to my knees cry i don't know what i think
RossLovegrove_2005-0039583-0040710 and i had access to all the best girls it was fabulous all the guys in the rugby team couldn't understand but anyway this is a meringue this is another sample i have a meringue is made exactly the same way in my estimation as a bone
RossLovegrove_2005-0050610-0051191 what nature does is it drills holes in things it liberates form it takes away anything extraneous
RossLovegrove_2005-0063620-0063776 we need to be in that
RossLovegrove_2005-0073746-0074626 sense of soup that delivers ideas single surface products furniture's a good one how you grow legs out of a surface
RossLovegrove_2005-0087872-0089097 if you put it next to contemporary architecture it feels totally natural to me and that's what i do with my furniture i'm not putting charles eames furniture in buildings any more forget that we move on i'm trying to build furniture that fits architecture i'm trying to build
RossLovegrove_2005-0100679-0100693 a
RossLovegrove_2005-0113045-0113298 so there's a new x light system i'm doing in japan
RoyGould_2008-0007804-0008777 it's going to change the way we do astronomy it's going to change the way we teach astronomy and i think most importantly it's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe
RoyGould_2008-0020002-0020279 it enables you to experience the universe
RoyGould_2008-0027808-0028095 and thanks to the creators of the worldwide telescope
RoyGould_2008-0034083-0035193 microsoft this is a project that worldwide telescope is dedicated to jim gray who's our colleague and a lot of his work that he did is really what makes this project possible
RozSavage_2010Z-0006278-0007142 it like i did about a very strict maths teacher that i once had at school i didn't always like her but i did respect her and she taught me a heck of a lot
RozSavage_2010Z-0018284-0019125 where i wanted to be by the end of my life i wanted to live a life that i could be proud of and i remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking
RozSavage_2010Z-0031705-0032495 at two miles an hour three thousand miles was going to take me a very very long time there were so many times when i thought i'd
RozSavage_2010Z-0044652-0045902 so how do you top rowing across the atlantic well naturally you decide to row across the pacific well i'd thought the atlantic was big but the pacific is really really big
RozSavage_2010Z-0060653-0061622 that area in the north pacific about twice the size of texas with an estimated three point five milion tons of trash in it circulating at the center of that north pacific
RozSavage_2010Z-0076166-0076984 and that made me think about how would i feel if britain was going to disappear under the waves if the places where i'd been born and gone to school
RozSavage_2010Z-0088936-0089876 the chernobyls but mostly it's been an accumulation of bad decisions by billions of individuals day after day and year after year
RozSavage_2010Z-0101749-0102859 we have a choice we've been blessed or cursed with free will we can choose a greener future and we can get there if we all pull together take it one
RubyWax_2012G-0021699-0023465 but we all know in here you know there is no devil there are no voices in your head you know that when you have those abusive voices all those little neurons get together and in that little gap you get a real toxic i want to kill myself kind of chemical and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape you might have yourself depression
RubyWax_2012G-0049338-0050306 it's not going to be one in four it's going to be four in four who are really really going to get ill in the upstairs department and while we're at it can we please stop the stigma thank you
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W-0016985-0017890 and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight we really wanted to let them understand what the realities of parenting were in an honest way
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W-0029663-0030055 this as you know is an act of heresy you're not allowed to chart love
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W-0041995-0042900 i suddenly felt very disconnected and suddenly shut in and shut out and i was really surprised by those feelings i did expect it to be difficult
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W-0054550-0054904 could go through this again and thought we knew what we'd be up against
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W-0067651-0068880 has declined since having a child the party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since i participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W-0080107-0080964 so we all remember as children the tiniest little thing and we see it on the faces of our children the tiniest little thing can just rocket them to these heights of
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W-0085347-0085563 but you lose those transcendent moments
RufusGriscomandAlisaVolkman_2010W-0090504-0090639 and this is a bonus taboo
RussellFoster_2013G-0004026-0004220 behavioral experience that we have
RussellFoster_2013G-0015853-0016424 what do we do in the twentieth century about sleep well of course we use thomas edison's light bulb
RussellFoster_2013G-0032226-0033318 is complicated and it takes thirty two years of our life but what i haven't explained is what sleep is about so why do we sleep
RussellFoster_2013G-0055066-0056852 if we think about other sectors of society the aged if you are aged then your ability to sleep in a single block is somewhat disrupted and many sleep again less than five hours a night shift work shift work is extraordinary perhaps twenty percent of the working population and
RussellFoster_2013G-0069551-0070995 and of course you're fueling the waking state with these stimulants and then of course it gets to eleven o'clock at night and the brain says to itself ah well actually i need to be asleep fairly shortly what do we do about that when i'm feeling completely wired well of course you then resort to alcohol
RussellFoster_2013G-0086330-0087890 if you are taking a long time to get up if you need lots of stimulants if you're grumpy if you're irritable if you're told by your work colleagues that you're looking tired and irritable chances are you are sleep deprived listen to them listen to yourself what do you do
RussellFoster_2013G-0107855-0109063 much of the time they were awake during the night phase and then they were asleep during the day other groups showed no twenty four hour patterns whatsoever their sleep was absolutely smashed and some
RussellFoster_2013G-0121389-0121906 early intervention then becomes possible and the third which i think is the most exciting
RyanLobo_2009I-0005874-0007184 and over there i experienced other people's suffering up close and personal immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories and at times i experienced great fear for my own life
RyanLobo_2009I-0024953-0025683 the general is a baptized christian evangelist and he's on a mission we accompanied joshua as he walked the
RyanLobo_2009I-0039041-0039465 use negotiation and tolerance more often than an armed response
RyanLobo_2009I-0055553-0056545 lack even the most basic amenities and this is something that is common to all our big cities back to the dfs a huge chemical depot caught fire
RyanMerkley_2012G-0005497-0007341 it's an online tool that allows anyone to combine video with content pulled live directly from the web videos created with popcorn behave like the web itself dynamic full of links and completely remixable and finally allowed to break free from the frame
SakiMafundikwa_2013-0005565-0006906 to talented students who have successfully completed their high school education and typography's a very important part of the curriculum and we encourage our students to look inward for influence
SakiMafundikwa_2013-0016615-0017489 developed this intricate writing system which is alive and well today in the new world in cuba
SakiMafundikwa_2013-0029489-0029858 struggle with all forms of design because
SakiMafundikwa_2013-0036089-0036561 and that story has been cast in stone as historical fact
SalmanKhan_2011-0006434-0006708 then you have no emotion
SalmanKhan_2011-0029058-0030266 and has had a terrible time with math we have tried everything viewed everything bought everything we stumbled on your video on decimals and it got through then we went on to the dreaded fractions again he got it
SalmanKhan_2011-0050069-0051341 you have a couple of homework homework lecture homework lecture and then you have a snapshot exam and that exam whether you get a seventy percent an eighty percent a ninety percent or a ninety five percent the class moves on to the next topic
SalmanKhan_2011-0065543-0066500 now that can work well for an individual learner and i encourage one for you to do it with your kids but i also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself it'll change what happens at the dinner table
SalmanKhan_2011-0080020-0081092 they watched the video right over there and then you can see eventually they were able to get ten in a row it's almost like you can see them learning over those last ten problems they also got faster the height is how long it took them
SalmanKhan_2011-0096302-0097321 that student in calcutta all of a sudden can tutor your son or your son can tutor that kid in calcutta and i think what you'll see emerging is this notion of
SamHarris_2010-0004763-0005300 questions like what is worth living for what is worth dying for what constitutes a good life
SamHarris_2010-0009239-0009509 facts about the wellbeing of conscious creatures
SamHarris_2010-0013077-0013200 and there is no
SamHarris_2010-0023232-0024048 whether or not we understand these truths and morality relates to these truths so in talking about values we are talking about facts
SamHarris_2010-0032100-0032908 and one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human wellbeing that we rarely access that few people access and these await our discovery
SamHarris_2010-0041496-0042659 we're not talking about connecticut and the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious the creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod lest we spoil the child
SamHarris_2010-0053665-0053848 an objective morality
SamHarris_2010-0062749-0063016 is one thing you can do about them you can cover them up
SamHarris_2010-0069649-0069955 just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute
SamHarris_2010-0079134-0080243 now the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another
SamHarris_2010-0084161-0084619 the demagogues are right about one thing we need a universal conception of human values
SamHarris_2010-0091378-0091632 notice that we don't do this in science
SamHarris_2010-0099732-0100170 the taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering
SamHarris_2010-0108108-0109184 respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human wellbeing than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads
SamHarris_2010-0122542-0123365 a a lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress but can you
SamMartin_2009G-0002845-0003635 when ford was about three years old we shared a very small room together in a very small space my office was on one half of the bedroom and his
SamMartin_2009G-0020392-0021335 and he trains in the space he trains other people and right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments which is another sort of important part
SamRichards_2010X-0008980-0009205 i saw people struggling to get by
SamRichards_2010X-0020941-0021547 if you can that's empathy that's empathy you've left your shoes and you've stood in mine
SamRichards_2010X-0036301-0037345 something else you see that you talk about americans don't talk about this but you do there's this thing this militarization of the world and it's centered right in the united states and the united states
SamRichards_2010X-0047012-0047505 once a life of happiness and joy and suddenly pain and sorrow
SamRichards_2010X-0064949-0066641 this is what you're thinking as an arab muslim as an iraqi of course you're going to think this and then your cousin says hey cuz check out this website you've got to see this bible boot camp these christians are nuts they're training their little kids to be soldiers for jesus
SamRichards_2010X-0081265-0081613 and the soldiers are chinese and everybody else is chinese
SamRichards_2010X-0093468-0094067 i'm going out to defend your freedom your lives i'm going out to look out for us
SamanthaPower_2008-0002712-0003715 i'd like to start by sharing with you one moment that to me sums up what there is to know about american and democratic responses to mass atrocity and that moment
SamanthaPower_2008-0017403-0018463 there's a museum of course on the mall in washington right next to lincoln and jefferson i mean we have owned never again culturally appropriately
SamanthaPower_2008-0030088-0030787 for not having an heroic imagination for not being an upstander but for being in fact a bystander now
SamanthaPower_2008-0037523-0038251 and the students and the others who are part of this incredibly energized base are there to answer that and there's always something to do
SamanthaPower_2008-0047570-0048574 so we have achieved an awful lot relative to the twentieth century and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding as we sit here as we speak
SanjayDastoor_2013-0006834-0007120 six miles of range or ten kilometers
SanjayPradhan_2012G-0003329-0005218 my brothers and i dug in and that's when my father came home he was livid and i still remember how we cried when that cart with our half eaten sweets was pulled away from us
SanjayPradhan_2012G-0017564-0017964 my initial work focused on uganda
SanjayPradhan_2012G-0039050-0040296 recently the world bank opened its vault of data for public use releasing eight thousand economic and social indicators for two hundred countries over fifty years
SanjayPradhan_2012G-0056308-0058264 tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual and what's exciting is that with this openness there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback
SanjayPradhan_2012G-0079420-0079888 though he was no lawyer he argued the case
SarahJayneBlakemore_2012G-0001653-0003260 years ago it was widely assumed that the vast majority of brain development takes place in the first few years of life back then fifteen years ago we didn't have the ability to look inside the living human brain and track development across the lifespan
SarahJayneBlakemore_2012G-0021658-0023183 is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning the elimination of unwanted synapses this is a really important process it's partly dependent on the environment that the animal or the human is in and the synapses that are being used are strengthened
SarahJayneBlakemore_2012G-0038867-0040195 decreases during the period of adolescence and we think that might be because adolescents and adults use a different mental approach a different cognitive strategy to make social decisions and one way of looking at that
SarahJayneBlakemore_2012G-0057532-0058387 to do in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid adolescence whereas in contrast if you look at the last two gray bars
SarahJayneBlakemore_2012G-0078274-0079258 so brain research has shown that the adolescent brain undergoes really quite profound development and this has implications for education
SarahJones_2009-0011554-0012204 and well they're very excited what i should tell you
SarahJones_2009-0024074-0024839 by saying just how lucky i feel it's such an eye opening experience to be here you're all so responsible
SarahJones_2009-0041264-0042105 to calm down and take a deep breath but then on top of that you know sarah jones told me we only have eighteen minutes so then i'm like should i be nervous you know because maybe it's better and i'm just trying not to panic and freak out so i like
SarahJones_2009-0055534-0055658 two weeks so
SarahJones_2009-0063323-0064224 it was like you know she was there in the class you know she was kind of typically french you know she was was very chic but she was very filled with ennui you know and
SarahJones_2009-0071202-0072028 and i wanted to start by telling you that once sarah jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to ted in california
SarahJones_2009-0081959-0082829 good english skills for speaking but then i decided just like governor arnold schwartzenegger i try anyway
SarahJones_2009-0091904-0092739 at college it's like she never came home and she doesn't want me to come and visit so i said what's wrong in this picture
SarahJones_2009-0103259-0103949 for my daughter's sake i thank you for your ideas worth spreading thank you
SarahJones_2009-0117570-0118520 on the radio they were very popular so all of that is to say that i like to believe that for every
SarahKay_2011-0013563-0015036 when your boots will fill with rain and you'll be up to your knees in disappointment and those are the very days you have all the more reason to say thank you because there's nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline no matter how many times it's sent away
SarahKay_2011-0038300-0038526 the first time that i performed
SarahKay_2011-0054508-0056391 we stayed full time students but in between we traveled performing and teaching nine year olds to mfa candidates from california to indiana to india to a public high school just up the street from campus and we saw over and over the way that spoken word poetry cracks open locks
SarahKay_2011-0075538-0076655 plus spoken word poetry allows for immediate connections it's not uncommon for people to feel like they're alone or that nobody understands them but spoken word teaches that if you have the ability to express yourself
SarahKay_2011-0099608-0100976 well neither do i but i see the impossible every day impossible is trying to connect in this world trying to hold onto others while things are blowing up around you knowing that while you're speaking they aren't just waiting for their turn to talk
SarahParcak_2012U-0011757-0013734 missing for thousands of years itjtawy was ancient egypt's capital for over four hundred years at a period of time called the middle kingdom about four thousand years ago the site is located in the faiyum of egypt and site is really important because in the middle kingdom there was this great renaissance for ancient egyptian art
Saraswati_2009P-0004867-0005119 it is helpless it doesn't know
Saraswati_2009P-0019874-0020065 capacity to
Saraswati_2009P-0032007-0032062 it can be
Saraswati_2009P-0041081-0041714 because it is empathy and that capacity
Saraswati_2009P-0051451-0051882 so one has got to discover a certain wholeness
Saraswati_2009P-0056575-0057161 accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds
Saraswati_2009P-0062322-0063029 in spite of all your limitations all your wants desires unfulfilled and
Saraswati_2009P-0072241-0072554 i have no more reason to blame myself
Saraswati_2009P-0083398-0083706 if the object that you relate to
Saraswati_2009P-0096048-0097141 but then how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion that is where you fake you fake it and make it this is the mantra of the united states of
SasaVucinic_2005G-0011406-0012173 countries can lose stars from their flags but they can also lose press freedom
SasaVucinic_2005G-0026214-0026868 i know at that time about media systems i would think media systems were organizations which means they should help
SasaVucinic_2005G-0041067-0042151 media bank and basically what i was saying is very simple you know forget about charity it doesn't work forget about handouts twenty thousand dollars do not help anybody
SasaVucinic_2005G-0053789-0055032 it's a kind of very nice sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper they come to us with a request for a loan they want to the only way for them to survive is to get a printing press
SasaVucinic_2005G-0061621-0062905 we do it in seventeen countries of the developing world and here is the most stunning number return rate the one that soros was so worried about ninety seven percent
SasaVucinic_2005G-0069933-0070807 city was closed until early nineties because of all things they were producing glass for tupolev planes
SasaVucinic_2005G-0084384-0085130 government accountability corruption how do you fight corruption giving voice to unheard to poor
SasaVucinic_2005G-0097293-0098333 success there's nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring and those can be environmental bonds
SaulGriffith_2006-0012727-0013679 headed by drew endy and tom knight and a few other very very bright individuals basically what they're doing is looking at biology as a programmable system literally think of
SaulGriffith_2006-0036066-0036592 computer revolution but it's now coming back so now i'm going to show you the hands free autonomous self replication
SaulGriffith_2006-0053026-0053898 so this actually applied to the problem of so there's a half a billion to a billion people in the world don't have access to cheap eyeglasses so
SaulGriffith_2006-0065105-0066216 that knows the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope just by thinking about the physics of the world materials as the computer you can start to do things like this
SaulGriffith_2006-0077757-0078760 to materials assembly it was great to hear bill joy they're starting to invest in materials science but these are the new things in materials science how do we put real information and real structure into
SaulGriffith_2006-0084727-0086515 this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe you could just hang it as a bed sheet but again the computation of all the physics gives you the aerodynamic shape and so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that so that's sort of another interesting aspect of the future
SaulGriffith_2009-0009667-0010564 and their experiments with kites led to this momentous occasion where we powered up and took off for the first ever twelve second human flight
SaulGriffith_2009-0022304-0023538 and the real significant thing here is we're developing the control systems as did the wright brothers that would enable sustained long duration flight and it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either
ScillaElworthy_2012X-0009204-0010267 and she said what on earth for and i said kids are getting killed there there's something terrible happening and she said don't be so silly and i started to cry
ScillaElworthy_2012X-0027094-0027766 and my heroine here like satish's is aung san suu kyi in burma
ScillaElworthy_2012X-0053947-0055635 it's people joining up with people as bundy just said miles away to bring about change and peace direct spotted quite early on that local people in areas of very hot conflict
ScillaElworthy_2012X-0069737-0070621 and chris hughes strode into the middle of the throng with his weapon above his head pointing at the ground and he said kneel
ScillaElworthy_2012X-0083626-0084817 we're getting practical doable methodologies to answer my question how do we deal with a bully without becoming
ScottFraser_2012X-0005329-0006038 and as the father was administering these instructions a car drove by slowly
ScottFraser_2012X-0017496-0017705 he was convicted he was sentenced to life imprisonment
ScottFraser_2012X-0026892-0027220 on the basis of later dna analysis
ScottFraser_2012X-0037906-0038399 that was part of the instigation for a group of appeal attorneys
ScottFraser_2012X-0050322-0050582 looking at the car going by and shooting
ScottFraser_2012X-0067187-0067387 and here i became a bit audacious
ScottFraser_2012X-0078453-0078607 there's fifteen feet
ScottFraser_2012X-0089401-0089629 three to four feet it might as well have been
ScottFraser_2012X-0100496-0101138 i think one large step toward that is more requirements with all due respect to the law schools
ScottFraser_2012X-0104774-0105078 examples and examples of cases like this
ScottFraser_2012X-0107093-0107583 they are the product of what we originally experienced and everything that's happened afterwards
ScottKim_2008P-0009999-0011291 i got hooked i read martin gardner's columns in scientific american went on and eventually decided to devote myself full time to that now i should pause and say what do i mean by puzzle a puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve
ScottKim_2008P-0024857-0025757 here we have the numbers one through ten the digits zero through nine actually each letter here is one of these digits not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense
ScottKim_2008P-0038403-0039691 play one here so here is a very simple puzzle well that's too simple let's add another piece okay so how would you solve this one well move the blue one out of the way here let's make it a little harder still pretty easy now we'll make it harder a little harder
ScottKim_2008P-0055503-0056288 you know for a long time computer games meant things like doom where you're going around shooting things very violent games very fast aimed at teenage boys right
ScottKim_2008P-0068640-0069720 yeah i've played this image before but even when i make up my own puzzles and you can put your own images in here and we have people all over the world doing that now there we are
ScottMcCloud_2005-0015861-0017158 so here's my dad he's a scientist he's an engineer and he's a military contractor so he has four kids right one grows up to become a computer scientist one grows up to join the navy
ScottMcCloud_2005-0030623-0031673 my dad's big easy chair you know so three types of vision right vision based on what one cannot see the vision of that unseen and unknowable
ScottMcCloud_2005-0045038-0045932 i saw it as just this road to discovery actually it was just me embracing my nature which means that i didn't actually fall that far from the tree after all
ScottMcCloud_2005-0060823-0061142 and within one hundred years you already start to see word
ScottMcCloud_2005-0076955-0077693 now the monitor is just as limited as the page technically right it's a different shape but other than that it's the same
ScottMcCloud_2005-0095828-0096087 i think this is important because media
SeanCarroll_2010X-0011500-0012123 you might think that that's not a surprise the air in this room is very smooth you might say well maybe things just smoothed themselves out
SeanCarroll_2010X-0029538-0030931 fifty years ago he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures he gave the popular lectures that became the character of physical law he gave lectures to caltech undergrads that became the feynman lectures on physics he gave lectures to caltech graduate students that became the feynman lectures on gravitation
SeanCarroll_2010X-0043139-0044416 but if there's dark energy and the dark energy does not go away the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever fourteen billion years in the past one hundred billion dog years but an infinite number of years into the future
SeanCarroll_2010X-0054853-0055866 everything that is allowed every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room would eventually be obtained so boltzmann says look you could start with a universe
SeanCarroll_2010X-0061058-0062932 depends on the arrow of time we would not be able to process information metabolize walk and talk if we lived in thermal equilibrium so if you imagine a very very big universe an infinitely big universe with randomly bumping into each other particles there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states and then they relax back
SeanCarroll_2010X-0069365-0070618 even if you imagine that this room we are in now exists and is real and here we are and we have not only our memories but our impression that outside there's something called caltech and the united states and the milky way galaxy
SeanCarroll_2010X-0081691-0082778 so even though the universe lasts forever there's only a finite number of things that can possibly happen in the universe they all happen over a period of time equal to ten to the ten to the one hundred and twenty years
SeanGourley_2009U-0004424-0004560 so i had to think a little harder
SeanGourley_2009U-0016000-0017193 why should a conflict like iraq have this as its fundamental signature why should there be order in war we didn't really understand that we thought maybe there is something special about
SeanGourley_2009U-0028957-0029239 to explain the patterns that we see all around
SeanGourley_2009U-0037315-0037793 the wars around the world look like and it stays there through the invasion of
SebastianDeterding_2011X-0020047-0020957 so that's a second very obvious question what are the effects of what you're doing the effects that you're having with the device like less fuel
SebastianDeterding_2011X-0033554-0035062 convinces muslim women to wear their headscarves is that a good or a bad technology in its intentions or in its effects well that basically depends on the kind of values that you bring to bear to make these kinds of judgments so that's
SebastianDeterding_2011X-0050834-0051941 and in the same way that we cannot not communicate we cannot not persuade whatever we do or refrain from doing whatever we put out there as a piece of design into the world
SebastianDeterding_2011X-0068048-0069553 just to give you a practical example of buster benson this is buster setting up a pull up machine at the office of his new startup habit labs where they're trying to build up other applications like health month for people and why is he building a thing like this
SebastianSeung_2010G-0010675-0011024 right all together now everybody i am
SebastianSeung_2010G-0023338-0023928 we need more sophisticated technologies that are automated that will speed up the process of finding connectomes
SebastianSeung_2010G-0036280-0036858 so you see how to find a synapse how can we find an entire connectome well we take
SebastianSeung_2010G-0048355-0049193 so here's how it stacks up against an entire neuron and you can tell that really only the smallest fragments of branches are contained inside this cube
SebastianSeung_2010G-0062597-0063389 mouse and human brain but even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis that i am my connectome
SebastianSeung_2010G-0076625-0077338 and with the stream i would like to propose a metaphor for the relationship between neural activity and connectivity
SebastianSeung_2010G-0083745-0084825 so let's return from the heights of metaphor and return to science suppose our technologies for finding connectomes actually work how will we go about testing the hypothesis i am my
SebastianSeung_2010G-0090418-0091182 so we'll have to use our computers to try to unscramble the chain and if we can do that the sequence of the neurons we recover
SebastianSeung_2010G-0101068-0102130 if you believe that i am my connectome i think you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your connectome
SebastianThrun_2011-0004075-0005423 i saw the concept first in the darpa grand challenges where the u s government issued a prize to build a self driving car that could navigate a desert and even though a hundred teams were there these cars went nowhere
SebastianThrun_2011-0012982-0013246 people didn't even notice
SebastianWernicke_2010A-0006253-0007245 now with the topic there's a whole range of topics you can choose but you should choose wisely because your topic strongly correlates with how users will react to your talk
SebastianWernicke_2010A-0017012-0017847 pushing the clock there's a few rules to obey i found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four word phrases that appear more often in the most
SebastianWernicke_2011X-0005608-0006135 having seen this danger to the economy i thought we need to find a solution to this problem
SebastianWernicke_2011X-0020523-0021926 each tedtalk individually because if you do the math you have a thousand tedtalks the pay ten cents each you have to do more than one summary for each of those talks because some of them will probably be or are really bad so i would end up paying hundreds of dollars
SebastianWernicke_2011X-0039968-0040591 so i had fifty overall summaries done this time i paid twenty five cents because i thought the task was a bit harder and
SebastiaoSalgado_2013-0033277-0033971 i started to have infection everywhere when i made love with my wife i had no sperm that came out of me
SebastiaoSalgado_2013-0083882-0084158 if you take a shower it takes you
SendhilMullainathan_2009I-0005388-0006215 really began with some diarrhea now we've known for a long time the cause of diarrhea that's why there is a glass of water up there
SendhilMullainathan_2009I-0023507-0024176 massive technological advance took an incredibly deadly disease made it solvable adherence rates how many people are taking their insulin every day
SendhilMullainathan_2009I-0040877-0041046 how is that possible well
SendhilMullainathan_2009I-0056565-0057729 almost out of kindergarten what is all this telling us you see what's going on here and in the bat and ball problem is that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world some models that you use to understand the world
SendhilMullainathan_2009I-0077539-0078466 so far i've been pretty negative i've been trying to show you the oddities of human behavior and i think maybe i'm being too negative maybe it's the diarrhea
SendhilMullainathan_2009I-0090422-0091762 and i think to tackle it we need to combine psychology marketing art we've seen that but you know what we need to combine it with we need to combine this with the scientific method see what's really
SendhilMullainathan_2009I-0104554-0105745 so the scientific method i alluded to is pretty important we work closely with companies that have operational capacity or nonprofits that have operational capacity and then we say well you want to get this behavior change let's come up with a few ideas test them
SergeyBrin_2004-0005413-0005529 this is what helped me see it
SergeyBrin_2004-0016113-0016440 and if we had it plotted correctly i think the international space station
SergeyBrin_2004-0027530-0027720 or in this case ketchup
SergeyBrin_2004-0036124-0036930 a part of in fact many of the organizations that are here the acumen fund i think approtec we have running i'm not sure if that one's up yet
SergeyBrin_2004-0046614-0047936 this is how we just deployed it we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out and now we've grown to over one hundred thousand members
SergeyBrin_2004-0058517-0058578 looking cute
SergeyBrin_2004-0069328-0070142 the other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important and so naturally people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities
SergeyBrin_2004-0081107-0081870 you can very easily take notes and they just get emailed automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting and as we become more of a global company
SergeyBrin_2004-0094953-0095665 much as we do on search so the idea is we can make advertising useful not just annoying right and
SergeyBrin_2004-0108714-0109988 our algorithms not a person of course but our algorithms our computers read his blog and decided that the related search was i am bored and he read this and he thought a person had decided that he was boring
SergeyBrin_2004-0121379-0122426 and that's unlike many of our competitors and i think decisions we're able to make like that have a tremendous impact on the world and makes me really proud to be involved with google so thank you
SergeyBrin_2013-0032167-0033926 so our first prototypes we built were huge it was like cell phones strapped to your head it was very heavy pretty uncomfortable we had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job and then she almost ran away screaming
SethBerkley_2010-0009228-0010229 the problem is if this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic
SethBerkley_2010-0021070-0021938 you know it's interesting because there are thirty odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now but we're still threatened by things like hiv and flu
SethBerkley_2010-0034386-0035253 while squadrons of killer t cells seek out and destroy cells that are already hiv infected the virus is defeated
SethBerkley_2010-0044846-0046256 so you've got this situation in two thousand and three we had an h five n one virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated cases with an apparent mortality rate of seventy percent
SethBerkley_2010-0051822-0052712 here's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to hiv a much wilder target
SethBerkley_2010-0057532-0058440 and vaccines were seen as poor business many thought that it was just impossible to make an aids vaccine but today evidence tells us otherwise
SethBerkley_2010-0070203-0071234 present that through a vaccine what we hope is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies and that would create a universal hiv vaccine
SethBerkley_2010-0083059-0083951 the first global flu pandemic in forty one years the u s government promised one hundred and fifty million doses of vaccine by october fifteenth for the flu peak
SethBerkley_2010-0097694-0098349 a company i'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the h spike flu that sparks the immune system
SethBerkley_2010-0112292-0113044 the continuity of life what the world needs now are these new vaccines and we can make it happen thank you very much
SethGodin_2003-0009005-0010243 patent is like or what the factory is like it's about can you get your idea to spread or not and i think that the way that you're going to get what you want or cause the change that you want to change to happen
SethGodin_2003-0026795-0027388 about water right articles about water ads about water imagine
SethGodin_2003-0039242-0039669 if the cow was purple isn't that a great special effect i could do that again if you
SethGodin_2003-0055314-0056392 and slowly it spread from one person to another person until finally it became the official bread of three star restaurants in paris now he's in london and he ships by fedex all around the world
SethGodin_2003-0066523-0067859 and what they do is they enter a city they talk to the people with otaku and then they spread through the city to the people who've just crossed the street this yoyo right here cost one hundred and twelve dollars but it sleeps for twelve minutes not everybody wants it but they don't care
SethGodin_2003-0078639-0079014 being remarkable sometimes a little too remarkable and
SethGodin_2003-0091577-0092243 frank gehry didn't just change a museum he changed an entire city's economy by designing one building
SethGodin_2009-0006135-0006614 but not often and the other thing about these guys is they also
SethGodin_2009-0017693-0018224 and within just a couple years san francisco became the first no kill city
SethGodin_2009-0035309-0035465 one thing instead of the
SethGodin_2009-0045561-0046848 got the organized armies over here you've got the disorganized rebels over here you've got people in white hats making food and people in white hats sailing boats the point is that you can find ukrainian folk dancers and connect with them
SethGodin_2009-0053284-0053696 is find something worth changing and then assemble
SethGodin_2009-0058153-0059550 round and the next round and the next round and that means that the idea you create the product you create the movement you create isn't for everyone it's not a mass thing that's not what this is about what it's about instead is finding the true believers
SethGodin_2009-0069543-0070046 the idea of caring about this issue but she helped organize people and helped turn it into a movement
SethGodin_2009-0078118-0078894 realize they make no sense and realize how much they want to be connected so tony shea does not run a shoe store
SethGodin_2009-0089693-0090403 if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes i gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn't even own a pair of shoes
SethGodin_2009-0101766-0102684 so i'd like you to do something for me and i hope you'll think about it before you reject it out of hand what i want you to do only takes twenty four hours
SethPriebatsch_2010X-0015235-0016033 and that's okay right a lot of people are very happy with facebook i like it quite a lot they've created this thing called the open graph and they own
SethPriebatsch_2010X-0029810-0031039 what you would think is a game played on a board or on a computer screen and then one how this can be used for good so we can see that these forces can really be very powerful so the first one the most famous appointment dynamic in the world is something called happy hour
SethPriebatsch_2010X-0043542-0044455 and you see men they have that black card i want that because that means that they're cooler than i am and i need that and this is used in games as well modern warfare one of the most successful selling games of all time
SethPriebatsch_2010X-0054790-0055779 you know orcs on the fields of mordor against the raz al ghul you'd probably want to be the bigger one right i would and so people work very hard to level up
SethShostak_2012X-0005294-0005515 hello come in earth
SethShostak_2012X-0020437-0022386 this is something that we're using today to search for e t and the electronics have gotten very much better too this is frank drake's electronics in one thousand nine hundred and sixty this is the allen telescope array electronics today some pundit with too much time on his hands has reckoned that the new experiments are approximately one hundred trillion times better
SethShostak_2012X-0034954-0035862 of these planets are actually suitable for life we don't know the answer to that either but we will learn that answer this year thanks to nasa's kepler space telescope
SethShostak_2012X-0054257-0055182 but it probably wouldn't have been right and i think that to predict what finding e t s going to mean we can't predict that either but here are a couple things i can say to begin with
SethShostak_2012X-0073162-0074608 polls taken this poll was taken ten years ago it shows like roughly one third of the public thinks that aliens are not only out there we're looking for them out there but they're here right sailing the skies in their saucers and occasionally abducting people for experiments their parents wouldn't approve of well
SethShostak_2012X-0093933-0095324 but if you give talks to kids you know one in fifty of them some light bulb goes off and they think gee i'd never thought of that and then they go you know read a book or a magazine or whatever they get interested in something now it's my
SeyiOyesola_2007G-0001255-0002284 just to put everything in context and to kind of give you a background to where i'm coming from so that a lot of the things i'm going to say and the things i'm going to do
SeyiOyesola_2007G-0008029-0008553 i should certainly hope not because that is not my vision all right
SeyiOyesola_2007G-0012157-0013157 how many people do you think are on that taxi and believe it or not that is a taxi in nigeria and the capital well what used to be the capital of nigeria lagos
SeyiOyesola_2007G-0024472-0025365 these are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden this is a major hospital in fact it's from a major teaching hospital in nigeria
SeyiOyesola_2007G-0034905-0035694 so these are the problems there are no prizes for telling us what the problems are are there i think we all know and
SeyiOyesola_2007G-0050835-0051604 well nowadays everything's on pax anyway you look at your x rays on a screen and you do stuff with them you email them
SeyiOyesola_2007G-0062637-0062713 thank you
SeyiOyesola_2007G-0078302-0079044 the mhra and the ce mark for those who don't know is the equivalent for europe of the fda in the u s
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X-0008109-0008265 to a secret school
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X-0015538-0015786 where education was prized
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X-0026227-0026460 and if we have to sell our blood
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X-0037285-0037478 and i see their parents
ShabanaBasijRasikh_2012X-0046284-0046525 it's not to say that our mothers aren't key
ShaffiMather_2009I-0001642-0001675 the
ShaffiMather_2009I-0019519-0020426 and as you can see from the visuals the service was responding and rescuing victims from the incident locations
ShaffiMather_2009I-0031387-0031895 now i come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that i'm exploring corruption
ShaffiMather_2009I-0045554-0046643 all she needed was permission to build three steps to her house from ground level making it easier for her to enter and exit her house yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit for
ShaffiMather_2009I-0059661-0060566 and making the world a fairer place what gives us the courage as my close friend replied when told during the seeding days of the ambulance project
ShaffiMather_2009I-0070691-0071457 but if it's a three thousand rupee seventy dollar bribe what fee would you have to charge and can you actually make the business work
ShaiAgassi_2009-0004860-0005700 a car if you use hydrogen so that is not going to be the path to go and then sort of through a process of wandering around i got to the
ShaiAgassi_2009-0017165-0017493 and so the first thought that came to mind is everywhere we park
ShaiAgassi_2009-0029236-0030067 but the crude oil is replaced with a battery just it doesn't burn it consumes itself step after step after step it has two thousand life cycles these days
ShaiAgassi_2009-0044661-0045889 peres thought that was a great idea so we went out and we looked at all the car companies we sent letters to all the car companies three of them never showed up one of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount
ShaiAgassi_2009-0056610-0057464 the third country we announced was australia it's got three centers in brisbane in melbourne in sydney and one freeway one electric freeway that connects them
ShaiAgassi_2009-0069568-0070224 in other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak and then we do the opec stimulus package also known as two hundred dollars a barrel
ShaiAgassi_2009-0080028-0081132 the indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in india fill two or three gallons every time for them to get a battery that goes one hundred and twenty miles is an extension on range not a reduction
ShaiAgassi_2009-0092834-0093688 and when we go to cop fifteen at the end of this year we can't stop thinking of padding co two we have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries who are willing to go to this kind of scale
ShaneKoyczan_2013-0001515-0001679 of
ShaneKoyczan_2013-0012620-0014513 see they asked me what i wanted to be then told me what not to be and i wasn't the only one we were being told that we somehow must become what we are not sacrificing what we are to inherit the masquerade of what we will be i was being told to accept the identity that others will give me
ShaneKoyczan_2013-0023982-0024348 doesn't have to mean embracing violence
ShaneKoyczan_2013-0036446-0037563 and i was removed from the house for three days until they finally decided to ask how i got the bruises news of this silly little story quickly spread through the school and i earned my first nickname
ShaneKoyczan_2013-0049386-0050645 had a personality made up of tests and pills lived like the uphills were mountains and the downhills were cliffs four fifths suicidal a tidal wave of antidepressants and an adolescence being called popper
ShaneKoyczan_2013-0061675-0061873 get a better mirror
ShaoLanHsueh_2013-0017094-0018242 a person if someone walks behind that is to follow as the old saying goes two is company three is a crowd
SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U-0010042-0010489 he joined the taliban a year ago when he was thirteen
SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U-0017059-0018346 they separate the parents from the children by promising to provide food clothing shelter to these children then they ship them off hundreds of miles away to hard line schools that run along the taliban agenda
SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U-0023907-0024628 they rarely allow them to play games they tell them that for eight hours at a time all they have to do is read the koran
SharmeenObaidChinoy_2010U-0035285-0035645 this boy is called sadik he killed twenty two
ShashiTharoor_2009I-0001594-0002721 and now as a politician and a government minister i've become rather concerned about the hype we're hearing about our own country all this talk about india becoming a world leader even the next superpower
ShashiTharoor_2009I-0017008-0018054 an incessant diet of internet news of televised images of cellphone videos of email gossip in other words all sorts of communication devices
ShashiTharoor_2009I-0032850-0034051 now fast forward to today and this is what you see the fifteen million cellphones a month but what is most striking is who is carrying those cellphones you know if you visit friends in the suburbs of delhi on the side streets
ShashiTharoor_2009I-0046548-0047905 i usually tend to think that the book is usually better but having said that the fact is that bollywood is now taking a certain aspect of indian ness and indian culture around the globe not just in the indian diaspora in the u s and the
ShashiTharoor_2009I-0060522-0061442 and what i see today you can't go to a mid size town in europe or north america and not find an indian restaurant it may not be a very good one but today in britain for example
ShashiTharoor_2009I-0073999-0074845 and to this day remains the only jewish diaspora in the history of the jewish people which has never encountered a single incident of anti semitism
ShashiTharoor_2009I-0096907-0098022 the great success story of india a country that so many learned scholars and jounalists assumed would disintegrate in the fifties and sixties is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus
ShawnAchor_2011X-0010953-0012030 so i did the only thing my little frantic seven year old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy and if you have children you've seen this hundreds of times before i said amy amy wait don't cry don't cry did you see how you landed
ShawnAchor_2011X-0022871-0023648 i can just delete that dot i can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error and we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data
ShawnAchor_2011X-0040005-0041531 when i went there i assumed everyone else would see it as a privilege as well that they'd be excited to be there even if you're in a classroom full of people smarter than you you'd be happy just to be in that classroom which is what i felt but what i found there is while some people experience that when i graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years
ShawnAchor_2011X-0058088-0059654 first every time your brain has a success you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like you got good grades now you have to get better grades you got into a good school and after you get into a better school you got a good job now you have to get a better job you hit your sales target we're going to change your sales target and if happiness is on the opposite side of success your brain never gets there
ShawnAchor_2011X-0071131-0073077 random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness we get people when they open up their inbox to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their social support network and by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies what we've found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success and in doing so not only create ripples of positivity but create a real revolution
SheaHembrey_2011-0022116-0023272 so i started thinking about how am i going to do this biennial how am i going to travel the world and find these artists and then i realized one day there's an easier solution to this
SheaHembrey_2011-0036626-0037146 but there's still the light above bright above and so you're standing there and everything else is dark but there's this portal that
SheaHembrey_2011-0044499-0044756 so what
SheaHembrey_2011-0054901-0055482 this next project this is by jaochim parisvega and he's interested in
SheaHembrey_2011-0076720-0078367 you know i would learn a lot about culture if i created a culture that doesn't exist from scratch so that's what she did she created the swiss people named the uvulites and they have this distinctive yodeling song that they use the uvula for and also they reference how the uvula everything they say is
SheenaIyengar_2010G-0004906-0005354 my first day i went to a restaurant and i ordered a cup of green tea with sugar
SheenaIyengar_2010G-0014584-0015096 but from the japanese perspective it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better
SheenaIyengar_2010G-0024120-0024516 and i did a series of studies in which we sought the answer to this very question
SheenaIyengar_2010G-0034892-0035232 named mary said you asked my mother
SheenaIyengar_2010G-0048690-0048773 of choosing alone
SheenaIyengar_2010G-0060785-0061076 you and i know that coke is the better choice
SheenaIyengar_2010G-0070072-0070421 in reality many choices are between things that are
SheenaIyengar_2010G-0086018-0086523 was seven months pregnant she started to experience contractions and was rushed to the emergency room
SheenaIyengar_2010G-0093791-0094121 the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be
SheenaIyengar_2010G-0100988-0101136 they could not imagine
SheenaIyengar_2010G-0110419-0110610 but when you take a close look
SheenaIyengar_2010G-0119435-0119774 we have far more to gain than to lose
SheenaIyengar_2010G-0129258-0130535 i guess one of the questions on everybody's mind is how does that influence your study of choosing because that's an activity that for most people is associated with visual inputs like aesthetics and color and so on
SheenaIyengar_2011S-0001648-0001961 how many choices you make in a typical day
SheenaIyengar_2011S-0008672-0009136 today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have
SheenaIyengar_2011S-0018881-0019052 we decided to do a little
SheenaIyengar_2011S-0034923-0035826 so for those people who did choose to participate the more choices available the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds
SheenaIyengar_2011S-0052665-0053544 and the first thing i do is i ask the employees tell me how these choices are different from one another and if your employees can't tell them apart neither can your consumers
SheenaIyengar_2011S-0071669-0071964 the magazine aisles range anywhere from three hundred and thirty
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W-0001970-0002634 which pat said makes seventy percent but according to our statistics it makes sixty percent of the region's population
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W-0018474-0018966 so i want to ask a question what should culture in the twenty first century look like
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W-0037390-0037929 create an open dialogue so that we share our ideas and share yours with us
SheikhaAlMayassa_2010W-0056675-0057465 first it allows us to showcase our arab filmmakers and voices to one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world new york city
SheilaNirenberg_2011P-0009908-0011511 and what i wanted to do is show you how it works okay so let me back up a little bit and show you how a normal retina works first so you can see the problem that we were trying to solve here you have a retina so you have an image a retina and a brain so when you look at something like this image of this baby's face
SheilaNirenberg_2011P-0017545-0017796 every millisecond telling your brain what it is
SheilaPatek_2004-0002068-0003136 so actually i started working on what's called the mantis shrimp a few years ago because they make sound this is a recording i made of a mantis shrimp that's found off the coast of california
SheilaPatek_2004-0015662-0016422 and i immediately came upon a problem every single high speed video system in the biology department at berkeley wasn't fast enough
SheilaPatek_2004-0027654-0027874 we were able to add a new point
SheilaPatek_2004-0040850-0041566 and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending and i'll just do that one more time
SheilaPatek_2004-0054039-0055357 and so i wired up what's called a load cell a load cell measures forces and this is actually a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it and when this crystal is squeezed the electrical properties change and it which in proportion to the forces that go in
SheilaPatek_2004-0070571-0071256 when this happens it can cause areas of very low pressure which results in the water literally vaporizing
SheilaPatek_2004-0084488-0085503 is that you have to molt and every three months or so these animals molt and they build a new limb and it's no problem very very convenient solution to that particular problem
SheilaPatek_2004-0091261-0091317 for real
SheilaPatek_2004-0096955-0097939 and also the miller institute for basic research in science which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time and for that i'm very grateful thank you very much
ShekharKapur_2009I-0020049-0020456 and the studio executives they would say hey look at shekhar he's all prepared and
ShekharKapur_2009I-0031536-0032815 you said that yesterday i'm just repeating it because that's what i follow constantly to find the shunyata somewhere the emptiness out of the emptiness comes a moment of creativity so that's what i do when i was a kid
ShekharKapur_2009I-0043064-0043821 is one atom in the ax of another woodcutter so every time i could tell my story again and again and get over this problem
ShekharKapur_2009I-0054716-0055789 if he had music if he had visuals if he had a video camera would we get buddhism better but that puts some kind of burden on me i have to tell a story in a much more elaborate way
ShekharKapur_2009I-0073730-0074747 growing older psychological the writer said it's about history plot i said it's about mythology the gods so
ShekharKapur_2009I-0094326-0095001 the stone is bigger than her because stone is inorganic it'll survive her so it's telling you to me stone is part of
ShekharKapur_2009I-0105242-0106280 and an idea started to develop so how does that become a story i suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster so my next film is called paani which means water
ShekharKapur_2009I-0118826-0119616 it's the effect of looking for harmony in the contradiction that exists in a poet's mind a contradiction that exists in a storyteller's mind
ShereenElFeki_2009G-0008511-0008590 from across the
ShereenElFeki_2009G-0025146-0026147 the ninety nine and four shbab are just two of many examples of this sort of islamic cross cultural hybridization we're not talking here about a clash of civilizations
ShereenElFeki_2012S-0010259-0011891 he was released but then a day or two later he was taken to the airport and he was deported what on earth did this man do to merit this treatment what was his terrible crime
ShereenElFeki_2012S-0025704-0027257 people such as those who inject drugs or sex workers or men who have sex with men or transgendered persons or migrants or prisoners and in many parts of the world that includes women and children who are especially vulnerable
ShereenElFeki_2012S-0041826-0042250 and this is exactly what happened to helma and dongo from namibia
ShereenElFeki_2012S-0062109-0062983 now drug use or possession is illegal in almost every country but some countries take a harder line on this than others
ShereenElFeki_2012S-0071323-0072119 the u s and malaysia came to harm reduction a little later and they have higher rates of hiv in these populations
ShereenElFeki_2012S-0077574-0079295 on the back of those reviews governments should repeal laws that punish or discriminate against people living with hiv or those at greatest risk repealing a law isn't easy and it's particularly difficult when it relates to touchy subjects like drugs and sex
ShereenElFeki_2012S-0085546-0086764 and also important is talking to communities so that we change interpretations of religious or customary law which is too often used to justify punishment and fuel stigma
SherryTurkle_2012-0007406-0008602 in those heady days we were experimenting with chat rooms and online virtual communities we were exploring different aspects of ourselves and then we unplugged
SherryTurkle_2012-0017916-0018193 but they've quickly come to seem familiar
SherryTurkle_2012-0029448-0029797 but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest you
SherryTurkle_2012-0038683-0039838 when i ask people what's wrong with having a conversation people say i'll tell you what's wrong with having a conversation it takes place in real time
SherryTurkle_2012-0050716-0051154 i mean look at how i felt when i got that text from my daughter
SherryTurkle_2012-0062797-0063430 during my research i worked in nursing homes and i brought in these sociable robots
SherryTurkle_2012-0070443-0071083 i found it one of the most wrenching complicated moments in my fifteen years of work
SherryTurkle_2012-0082271-0083611 but more than a symptom constant connection is changing the way people think of themselves it's shaping a new way of being the best way to describe it is i share therefore i am
SherryTurkle_2012-0096704-0097657 with technology and we're afraid like young lovers that too much talking might spoil the romance but it's time to talk
SherryTurkle_2012-0104470-0104952 because it's when we stumble or hesitate or lose our words
SherryTurkle_2012-0113723-0113958 going to the pub with friends
SherwinNuland_2001-0008918-0009971 up to the late middle ages the renaissance are filled with prescriptions for causing convulsions to shake the evil spirits out
SherwinNuland_2001-0022895-0023964 so these three psychiatrists after about two or three weeks of observation laid him down on a table connected his temples to a very small source of current they thought well
SherwinNuland_2001-0037413-0038338 without causing any convulsion in the body except a little bit of twitching of the toes so again it was very very popular and very very useful
SherwinNuland_2001-0047383-0048470 there are i'm sure enough divorced people in this room to know about the hostility the anger who knows what being someone who had
SherwinNuland_2001-0056252-0056744 i had myself admitted to the acute care psychiatric unit of our university hospital
SherwinNuland_2001-0061788-0062669 and it was clear not to me because nothing was clear to me at that time anymore that i would need long term hospitalization
SherwinNuland_2001-0075332-0076335 so they decided i didn't know this again i found this out later that the only thing that could be done was for this forty three year old man to have a pre frontal
SherwinNuland_2001-0089995-0091253 i had the sense i really had the sense that i could overcome this that i was now strong enough that by an act of will i could blow the obsessional thinking away i could blow the depression away
SherwinNuland_2001-0101997-0103145 in the community not in new haven but fairly close by i stayed there for three years at the end of three years i went back to new haven had remarried by
SherwinNuland_2001-0111680-0111889 with my own personal experiences
SherwinNuland_2001-0122205-0123424 anything can happen to you things change accidents happen something from childhood comes back to haunt you you can be thrown off the track i hope it happens to none of you but it will probably
SherwinNuland_2001-0131358-0131979 the most popular resurrection theme outside of specifically religious ones is the one
SherwinNuland_2003-0011884-0012980 out of a form of love and this gives me enormous hope and hope of course is the topic that i'm supposed to be speaking about which i'd completely forgotten about until i
SherwinNuland_2003-0025040-0026366 and it was one by vaclav havel in his perfectly spectacular book breaking the peace in which he says that hope does not consist of the expectation that things will come out exactly right
SherwinNuland_2003-0037561-0038565 brought to life in the early part of the nineteenth century actually in the second decade of the nineteenth century by a twenty seven year old poet
SherwinNuland_2003-0050354-0051003 but there should be virtually no argument about whether we should be
SherwinNuland_2003-0061466-0062725 so here we are we are should be morally committed to being the healer of the world and
SherylSandberg_2010W-0001635-0002029 so for any of us in this room today let's start out by admitting we're lucky
SherylSandberg_2010W-0013424-0013590 and he said no we've been here
SherylSandberg_2010W-0023263-0023470 at home or whether they're in the workforce
SherylSandberg_2010W-0029930-0030375 and my brother smart guy but a water polo playing pre med who was a sophomore
SherylSandberg_2010W-0035551-0035669 you got the top grade in
SherylSandberg_2010W-0042439-0042672 by sitting on the side not at the table
SherylSandberg_2010W-0049445-0049648 but that one word made a really
SherylSandberg_2010W-0058265-0058783 i thought to myself wow if it's me who cares about this obviously giving this talk
SherylSandberg_2010W-0069281-0070165 and if that wasn't good enough motivation for everyone out there they also have more how shall i say this on this stage they know each other more in the biblical sense as
SherylSandberg_2010W-0080077-0080532 to be challenging it needs to be rewarding you need to feel like you're making a difference
SherylWuDunn_2010G-0001727-0001896 that i want to talk to you about today
SherylWuDunn_2010G-0011380-0011886 thirteen dollar checks because new york times readers are very generous in tiny amounts
SherylWuDunn_2010G-0019635-0020015 and that brings me to my first major of two tenets of
SherylWuDunn_2010G-0024503-0025037 there are true enough in europe and the west when women and men have
SherylWuDunn_2010G-0031004-0031173 from one to five
SherylWuDunn_2010G-0041157-0042030 you need to use scarce resources it's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like dai manju bill gates put it very well when he was traveling through saudi arabia
SherylWuDunn_2010G-0047884-0048729 now modern slavery according to state department rough statistics there are about eight hundred thousand ten times the number
SherylWuDunn_2010G-0057185-0057476 tearing during obstructed labor that leaves a woman
SherylWuDunn_2010G-0068416-0069427 she tends to have kids later on in life she tends to have fewer kids and those kids that she does have she educates them in a more enlightened fashion with economic opportunity it can be
SherylWuDunn_2010G-0078208-0079337 larry summers when he was chief economist at the world bank once said that it may well be that the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls education
SherylWuDunn_2010G-0093309-0093523 turns out that it's a failed irrigation project
SherylWuDunn_2010G-0101272-0101948 here was was a woman who had worked in darfur seeing things that no human being should see
SherylWuDunn_2010G-0106559-0106713 that with that great fortune
ShigeruBan_2013X-0026827-0028033 but over two million people cut trees it just became big heavy deforestation and an environmental problem that is why they started providing aluminum pipes aluminum barracks very expensive they throw them out for money
ShigeruBan_2013X-0067166-0068346 and the most important cathedral of the city the symbol of christchurch was totally destroyed and i was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral so this is under construction
ShiloSuleman_2011P-0032971-0034929 i think a big problem has been in the last ten years is that children have been locked inside their rooms glued to their pcs they haven't been able to get out but now with mobile technology we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology one of the interactions in the book is that you're sent off on this quest where you need to go outside
ShimonSchocken_2010X-0003420-0003734 with this country's history
ShimonSchocken_2010X-0014235-0014399 a correction facility these
ShimonSchocken_2010X-0023089-0023376 not because they were physically unfit but that's one reason why
ShimonSchocken_2010X-0031882-0032061 away from the nearest road
ShimonSchocken_2010X-0039092-0039135 and i
ShimonSchocken_2010X-0053641-0053930 most importantly love and respect to yourself
ShimonSchocken_2010X-0065008-0065154 ignore the immediate obstacles and
ShimonSchocken_2010X-0073649-0073754 and made a difference
ShimonSchocken_2010X-0082261-0082476 that were established by holocaust
ShimonSchocken_2012G-0007173-0007723 and he paid each one of them a monthly salary so that they could write in peace
ShimonSchocken_2012G-0023002-0023799 and indeed it is impossible to connect with the soul of the machine if you interact with a black box p c or a mac
ShimonSchocken_2012G-0042543-0042993 and in short order thousands of people were building our machine
ShimonSchocken_2012G-0055536-0057244 i did the coursework because understanding computers is important to me just like literacy and numeracy and i made it through i never worked harder on anything never been challenged to this degree but given what i now feel capable of doing i would certainly do it again
ShimonSchocken_2012G-0064029-0065529 and yet we don't tolerate mistakes and we worship grades so we collect your b pluses and your a minuses and we aggregate them into a number like three point four which is stamped on your forehead and sums up who you are
ShimonSchocken_2012G-0076695-0077323 you can glue them and then proceed to tile just like we did before
ShimonSchocken_2012G-0096977-0097436 the most important thing is to be a mensch
ShimonSteinberg_2010X-0010531-0010605 just
ShimonSteinberg_2010X-0020062-0020303 parts of those spiders
ShimonSteinberg_2010X-0031583-0032460 through this parasitic wasp here we are not talking about a predator here we are talking a parasite not a two legged parasite
ShimonSteinberg_2010X-0044010-0044542 the pest the thrips by the way all these weird names i
ShimonSteinberg_2010X-0056949-0057870 those creatures and by the way mass production it is not genetic manipulation there are no gmo's genetically modified organisms whatsoever
ShimonSteinberg_2010X-0067611-0068652 more than one thousand hectares ten thousand dunams in israeli terms of biological pest controlling sweet pepper under protection seventy five percent
ShimonSteinberg_2010X-0080601-0081438 growers become aware of the fact they should wherever they can and wherever possible replace the chemical control
ShimonSteinberg_2010X-0091214-0091415 and abroad really
ShirinNeshat_2010W-0015413-0015606 we are there to inspire
ShirinNeshat_2010W-0021569-0022069 i did not start to make social commentary about my country
ShirinNeshat_2010W-0050571-0050981 these are some of the images and the characters of the film
ShlomoBenartzi_2011S-0007997-0009799 we were risk takers of course then market stocks seize and we're like wow these losses they feel emotionally they feel very different from what we actually thought about it when markets were going up
ShlomoBenartzi_2011S-0034040-0034672 and then we can hopefully flip the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions
ShlomoBenartzi_2011S-0047462-0048810 when you get your driving license or an i d you check the box saying i would like to donate my organs not many people like checking boxes it takes effort you need to think twelve percent do
ShlomoBenartzi_2011S-0061432-0063407 we hate losing stuff even if it doesn't mean a lot of risk you would hate to go to the atm take out one hundred dollars and notice that you lost one of those dollar twenty bills it's very painful even though it doesn't mean anything those twenty dollars might have been a quick lunch
ShlomoBenartzi_2011S-0076496-0077332 makes it easy it's an autopilot once you tell me you would like to save more in the future
ShlomoBenartzi_2011S-0104303-0105358 less than three percent of a very sophisticated audience behavioral finance has a long way there's a lot of opportunities to make it powerful again
ShuklaBose_2009I-0010801-0011673 hundred million children who go to school but can not read one hundred and twenty five million who can not do basic
ShuklaBose_2009I-0022506-0023468 times all of us would be huddled under the tin roof waiting for the rain to stop my god what a bonding exercise that was
ShuklaBose_2009I-0033074-0033129 writing
ShuklaBose_2009I-0050882-0052103 we have a few months ago actually late last year we had a few mothers who came to us and said you know we want to learn how to read and write can you teach us so we started
ShuklaBose_2009I-0070251-0070264 it
ShuklaBose_2009I-0081788-0082535 creating an environment of learning of inquiry of exploration is what is true education
ShuklaBose_2009I-0095391-0096511 is parikrma with a simple beginning but a long way to go i promise you parusharam will speak in the ted conference a few years from now
ShyamSankar_2012G-0016691-0018185 of course in other ways humans are so limited we're terrible at scale computation and volume we require high end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing licklider foresaw computers doing all the routinizable work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making
ShyamSankar_2012G-0030283-0031416 so if you want to improve human computer symbiosis what can you do you can start by designing the human into the process instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem design the solution around what the human will do as well
ShyamSankar_2012G-0043587-0044597 computers don't detect novel patterns and new behaviors but humans do humans using technology testing hypotheses searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them
ShyamSankar_2012G-0062101-0063247 these were networks of mercenaries not ideologues who were in the coordination business for profit for example they charged saudi foreign fighters substantially more than libyans money that would have otherwise gone to al qaeda
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008-0002942-0003118 but we do not know his face
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008-0010921-0011441 so we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008-0019773-0020993 what was the age of leonardo at the time does that fit yes it does he was thirty three thirty eight and sixty three when these were made so we have three pictures potentially of the same person of the same age as leonardo at the time
SimonBerrow_2010X-0006283-0007302 the basking sharks this is an old woodcut from the seventeen one thousand eight hundred s so they were very important and they were important for the oil out of their liver a third of the size of the basking shark is their liver and it's full of oil you get gallons of oil from their liver
SimonBerrow_2010X-0018970-0020185 the importance of basking sharks to the coast communities is recognized through the language now i don't pretend to have any irish but in kerry they were often known as ainmhide na seolta the monster with the sails
SimonBerrow_2010X-0037313-0039044 what happens is that you set the tag to detach from the shark after a fixed period in this case it was eight months and literally to the day the tag popped off drifted up said hello to the satellite and sent not all the data but enough data for us to use and this is the only way to really work out the behavior and the movements when they're under water
SimonBerrow_2010X-0058926-0059682 and using different microsatellites gave the different results but the average of all these studies came out the mean is about five thousand
SimonBerrow_2010X-0085832-0087425 we managed to collect slime and here it is look at that lovely black shark slime and in about half an hour we got five samples five individual sharks were sampled using simon's shark slime sampling system
SimonLewis_2010P-0003582-0004998 and it raises an existential question which is if i'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness why am i not visible in the photograph and where is this time and place this is los angeles california where i live
SimonLewis_2010P-0020889-0021883 we had to learn how to crack open animal bones use tools to do that to feed on the marrow to grow our brains more so we actually grew our consciousness in response to this global threat
SimonLewis_2010P-0039997-0040809 we're talking about a society that is retreating into depression and disassociation when we are potentially confronting the next
SimonLewis_2010P-0055148-0057087 one of the doctors said that my recovery my degree of advance since the amount of head injury i'd suffered was miraculous and that was when i started to write a book because i didn't think it was miraculous i thought there were miraculous elements but i also didn't think it was right that one should have to struggle and search for answers when this is a pandemic within our society
SimonLewis_2010P-0066981-0067250 what does average i q really mean
SimonLewis_2010P-0071102-0072182 but they felt the evidences that there was important valuable information in the book and they commented about it when they gave the full peer review to it but they asked one question they said is this repeatable
SimonLewis_2010P-0087531-0087975 you get a vascular migraine this is a level of pain that's only known
SimonLewis_2010P-0095115-0095792 where does it go inside the body it has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion free for over eighty years
SimonLewis_2010P-0121827-0122778 this thing blinks all the time i'll leave it out so you might be able to see it but this is blinking all the time it's sending signals in real time and if you walk faster if i walk faster
SimonSinek_2009X-0007586-0007798 powered man flight and the wright brothers beat them to it
SimonSinek_2009X-0016113-0016281 and by why i don't mean to make a profit
SimonSinek_2009X-0027106-0028337 all i did was reverse the order of information what it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do people buy why you do it people don't buy what you do they buy why you do it this explains why every single person in this room
SimonSinek_2009X-0045653-0046625 and people respond to why you do what you do then how you ever get people to vote for you or buy something from you or more importantly be loyal
SimonSinek_2009X-0051254-0052241 to be the recipe for success i mean even now you ask people why did your product or why did your company fail and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things
SimonSinek_2009X-0056649-0057540 of what we consider to be the recipe for success they had no money they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop not a single person on the wright brothers team
SimonSinek_2009X-0072883-0074072 find the ones that get it before you're doing business with them versus the ones who don't get it so it's this here this little gap that you have to close as jeffrey moore calls it crossing the chasm
SimonSinek_2009X-0085253-0085605 a commercial failure they've never made money
SimonSinek_2009X-0096416-0097161 took his cause and they made it their own and they told people and some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people
SirKenRobinson_2006-0001944-0002233 you it's been great hasn't it
SirKenRobinson_2006-0013588-0014497 nobody has a clue despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days what the world will look like in five years time and yet we're meant to be educating them for
SirKenRobinson_2006-0028507-0029261 didn't have to speak but you know the bit where the three kings come in they come in bearing gifts and they bring gold frankincense and myrhh this really happened we were sitting there and
SirKenRobinson_2006-0048667-0049107 long time when you're sixteen anyway he was really upset on the plane and he said i'll never find another girl like
SirKenRobinson_2006-0065291-0065611 there you will see it grown men and women writhing uncontrollably
SirKenRobinson_2006-0078314-0079400 we think about the world in all the ways that we experience it we think visually we think in sound we think kinesthetically we think in abstract terms we think in movement secondly intelligence is dynamic
SirKenRobinson_2006-0095397-0095467 they could have that
SirKenRobinson_2006-0113861-0114954 task is to educate their whole being so they can face this future by the way we may not see this future but they will and our job is to help them make something of it thank you very much
SirKenRobinson_2010-0017064-0017949 don't think they're really good at anything actually i kind of divide the world into two groups now jeremy bentham the great utilitarian philosopher
SirKenRobinson_2010-0035615-0035843 we suppress it you know this is our policy so
SirKenRobinson_2010-0049601-0049795 a single function device
SirKenRobinson_2010-0066290-0067118 at the heart of the challenge is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence this linearity thing is a problem
SirKenRobinson_2010-0071417-0072347 but as we just heard in this last session there's such competition now to get to kindergarten to get to the right kindergarten that people are being interviewed for it
SirKenRobinson_2010-0077114-0077782 this is something jamie oliver talked about the other day you know there are two models of quality assurance in catering one is fast food where everything
SirKenRobinson_2010-0086707-0087714 and the reason so many people are opting out of education is because it doesn't feed their spirit it doesn't feed their energy or their passion so i think we have to change metaphors
SirKenRobinson_2010-0100809-0101341 i the heavens embroidered cloths enwrought with gold and silver light
SirKenRobinson_2013S-0005937-0006165 it's one of those cultural myths
SirKenRobinson_2013S-0015112-0015437 from an economic point of view this is good math isn't
SirKenRobinson_2013S-0020116-0020492 by the culture of education under which most teachers
SirKenRobinson_2013S-0032247-0032431 i just don't believe it's an epidemic
SirKenRobinson_2013S-0047372-0047865 but a wonderful guy he was wonderful
SirKenRobinson_2013S-0056457-0056654 but all that should support
SirKenRobinson_2013S-0075467-0075775 is currently what is not evident
SirKenRobinson_2013S-0087659-0087941 education is an industrial process
SirKenRobinson_2013S-0098288-0098850 and conditions under which they don't we are after all organic creatures
SirKenRobinson_2013S-0109660-0110402 and if you do that people will rise to it and achieve things that you completely did not anticipate and couldn't have expected
SirenaHuang_2006-0062916-0063070 i remember when i
SirenaHuang_2006-0103345-0103823 for actually caring for us a lot and to make our future
SkylarTibbits_2011U-0011351-0011643 and use that to fold up or reconfigure
SkylarTibbits_2011U-0021838-0022335 so what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do
SkylarTibbits_2011U-0030983-0031522 two cubes next to each other
SkylarTibbits_2013U-0007089-0008066 but if we look at the human scale there's massive problems that aren't being addressed by those nanoscale technologies if we look at construction and manufacturing
SkylarTibbits_2013U-0020110-0021373 all of the intricacies and this gives us a tangible model of the three dimensional protein and how it folds and all of the intricacies of the geometry so we can study this as a physical intuitive model
SkylarTibbits_2013U-0032885-0033353 we also worked with autodesk on a software they're developing called project cyborg
SkylarTibbits_2013U-0046608-0048230 so i would like to invite you from whatever industry you're from to join us in reinventing and reimagining the world how things come together from the nanoscale to the human scale so that we can go from a world like this to a world that's more like this
SonaarLuthra_2011G-0009233-0010901 i've been inspired by that simplicity as i've been working on this problem with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people i've ever known we think there's a simpler solution to this problem one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday it's in its early stages but this is what it looks like right now
SoniaShah_2013G-0007798-0008645 and yet to this day hundreds of thousands of people are going to die from the bite of a mosquito why is that
SoniaShah_2013G-0021610-0023331 so say you came up with some great drug that worked against one stage of the parasite's life cycle it might do nothing at all to any of the other stages it can hide in our bodies undetected unbeknownst to us for days for weeks for months for years in some cases even decades
SoniaShah_2013G-0039947-0040319 so there's a huge economic challenge in taming malaria
SoniaShah_2013G-0062528-0063634 the whole campaign crashed malaria resurged back but now it was even worse than before because it was corralled into the hardest to reach places in the most difficult to control forms
SoniaShah_2013G-0086073-0087195 take the example of england and the united states we had malaria in those countries for hundreds of years and we got rid of it completely not because we attacked malaria we didn't
SophalEar_2009U-0013576-0014357 the khmer rouge didn't believe in money so the equivalent of the federal reserve bank in cambodia was bombed but not just that they actually
SophalEar_2009U-0028106-0028874 idyllic place on the mekong delta but for us it meant freedom and freedom from persecution from the khmer rouge
SpencerWells_2007G-0010604-0011564 now the problem of human diversity like all big scientific questions how do you explain something like that can be broken down into sub questions and you can ferret away at those little sub questions
SpencerWells_2007G-0029605-0030094 that means that not all three could be my direct ancestor which one of these guys am i actually related to
SpencerWells_2007G-0041582-0042812 what we need to do is turn the problem on its head because what we're really asking is a genealogical problem or a genealogical question what we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today
SpencerWells_2007G-0049714-0050694 how long is it well it's billions of these subunits in length a haploid genome we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes a haploid genome is around three point two billion nucleotides in length
SpencerWells_2007G-0059691-0060421 all the way back to the very first woman the y chromosome the piece of dna that makes men men traces a purely paternal line of descent
SpencerWells_2007G-0071617-0072904 now that seems so recent why didn't we start to leave earlier why didn't homo erectus evolve into separate species or sub species rather human races around the world why was it that we seem to have come out of africa so recently
SpencerWells_2007G-0093455-0094551 you're it the reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in africa probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now around sixty seventy thousand years ago
SpencerWells_2007G-0109231-0110243 you know a handful of populations around the world studied a few genetic markers and there are lots of gaps on this map we've just connected the dots what we need to do is increase our sample size
SrdjaPopovic_2011X-0003796-0004801 somebody gives you a bet you will look at a crystal ball and you will see the future the future will be accurate but you need to share it with the world okay curiosity killed the cat
SrdjaPopovic_2011X-0020123-0021777 the rest is the year in front of us and guess what the same generation epsilon with their rules with their tools with their games and with their language which sounds a little bit strange to me i am thirty eight now and can you look at the age of the people on the streets of europe
SrdjaPopovic_2011X-0046206-0046368 sounds loud
SrdjaPopovic_2011X-0061185-0061657 whether the syrians will maintain nonviolent discipline
SriSwamiDayanandaSaraswati_2009P-0007765-0008420 it
SriSwamiDayanandaSaraswati_2009P-0027033-0028444 compassion is just a word and a dream you can be compassionate occasionally
SriSwamiDayanandaSaraswati_2009P-0052184-0053228 i am going to cite the possibility of being whole which is within our experience everybody's experience
SriSwamiDayanandaSaraswati_2009P-0066749-0067019 the
SriSwamiDayanandaSaraswati_2009P-0094830-0095708 for compassion that's interesting to me you act compassionately
StaceyKramer_2010-0007509-0008123 and get this you'll have an eight week vacation of doing absolutely nothing
StaceyKramer_2010-0017296-0017457 in all the ways i just shared with you
StanleyMcChrystal_2011-0008921-0009401 and it's painful enough now and i think it's designed this way it's painful enough so you want to jump
StanleyMcChrystal_2011-0013158-0013747 you go through some additional checks and then they open the door and this was that tuesday morning in september
StanleyMcChrystal_2011-0016947-0017206 an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that
StanleyMcChrystal_2011-0025976-0026143 i'd shake my head
StanleyMcChrystal_2011-0033080-0033285 but things changed so much
StanleyMcChrystal_2011-0039575-0039733 and we did an operation
StanleyMcChrystal_2011-0047579-0049169 more importantly the force that i led was spread over more than twenty countries and instead of being able to get all the key leaders for a decision together in a single room and look them in the eye and build their confidence and get trust from them i'm now leading a force that's dispersed
StanleyMcChrystal_2011-0057513-0057730 also the people had changed
StanleyMcChrystal_2011-0066444-0066620 and shared consciousness
StanleyMcChrystal_2011-0076123-0076490 in a firefight in real time and you can't do anything about it
StanleyMcChrystal_2011-0086069-0086425 and having that kind of relationship for me turned out to be critical
StefanSagmeister_2004-0004117-0004406 i'm going to be miserable indeed
StefanSagmeister_2004-0009374-0009635 it's going to be really miserable and stressful
StefanSagmeister_2004-0015437-0015501 i did do
StefanSagmeister_2004-0025559-0025822 authors photos on the back of their monographs
StefanSagmeister_2004-0032836-0033244 this apple by yoko ono that of course later on was you know
StefanSagmeister_2004-0038507-0038628 maybe with the exception
StefanSagmeister_2004-0045167-0045759 a couple of weeks ago designed a box set for the talking heads where the happiness
StefanSagmeister_2004-0048817-0049200 everybody who has ridden the new york subway system will be familiar
StefanSagmeister_2004-0056974-0057678 from the mta to everybody sort of like pretending that it's an art project financed by the metropolitan transit authority
StefanSagmeister_2004-0062888-0063045 for sure made me happy as well
StefanSagmeister_2004-0074121-0074498 was a question of course that was on my mind for a while
StefanSagmeister_2004-0082635-0082899 the whole thing just fell together so i just
StefanSagmeister_2008-0002258-0002396 i showed a list
StefanSagmeister_2008-0011941-0012938 money does not make me happy appeared first as double page spreads in a magazine the printer lost the file didn't tell us
StefanSagmeister_2008-0023994-0024246 very last one is a
StefanSagmeister_2009G-0008804-0009859 to close it down for one year also is the knowledge that right now we spend about in the first twenty five years of our lives learning
StefanSagmeister_2009G-0022838-0023929 coming from the area itself however the first thing that i needed was mosquito repellent typography because they were definitely around heavily
StefanSagmeister_2009G-0032661-0033404 and we had custom espresso cups made that hide a magnet inside and make those compasses go crazy
StefanSagmeister_2009G-0043439-0044707 there is some good successes scotch tape came out of this program as well as art fry developed sticky notes from during his personal time for three m
StefanSagmeister_2009G-0055520-0056453 and then made a plan very much like in grade school what does it say here monday eight to nine story writing nine to ten future thinking
StefanSagmeister_2009G-0069303-0070159 which when you actually have to design a beethoven poster comes in handy because the visual information of the logo and
StefanSagmeister_2009G-0080908-0081935 some of you might have seen it i showed some of it at earlier teds before under the title things i've learned in my life so far i'll just show two now
StefanSagmeister_2009G-0096672-0097889 they weren't quite slick enough so we asked the goose to do it again and hoped she would do somehow a more elegant or pretty job and i think she overdid it just a bit too ornamental
StefanSagmeister_2010S-0004824-0005180 seemed the last thing that was interesting to me
StefanSagmeister_2010S-0013580-0015152 very very similar levels of happiness this is a very quick overview of all the studies that i looked at that climate plays no role that if you live in the best climate in san diego in the united states or in the shittiest climate in buffalo new york
StefanSagmeister_2010S-0023725-0025339 the big decisions in my life would have been made for me meaning i would have stayed in the town that i was born in i would have very much likely entered the same profession that my dad did and i would have very much likely married a woman that my mom had selected
StefanSagmeister_2010S-0039301-0039923 i'm a big list maker so i came up with a list one of them is to think without pressure
StefanSagmeister_2010S-0054194-0054411 keeping a diary since i was twelve
StefanWolff_2010G-0009622-0010063 been a near constant presence as a major international security
StefanWolff_2010G-0017713-0018270 in the middle east conflict between israelis and palestinians continues unabated
StefanWolff_2010G-0025745-0025955 the number of people killed in civil wars
StefanWolff_2010G-0035367-0036103 rape and ethnic cleansing have become highly effective if often non lethal weapons in civil war
StefanWolff_2010G-0041554-0042062 the defeat of the tamil tigers in sri lanka is perhaps the most recent example of this
StefanWolff_2010G-0049606-0049899 was skillfully mediated by senator george mitchell
StefanWolff_2010G-0057670-0058058 local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise
StefanWolff_2010G-0067550-0067878 local leaders committed to revisiting them later on
StefanWolff_2010G-0076799-0076967 an international diplomatic
StefanWolff_2010G-0084701-0085129 the civil war in sudan from than in liberia both
StefanWolff_2010G-0094285-0095362 that recognizes each others needs and they need to think about the substance of their agreement much more than about the labels they want to attach to them
StefanWolff_2010G-0102335-0102583 it often takes a generation to accomplish
StefanaBroadbent_2009G-0008388-0009654 the mobile phone texting etc what we're actually going to see is that fundamentally people are communicating on a regular basis with five six seven of their most intimate sphere now lets take some data
StefanaBroadbent_2009G-0019116-0020026 who manages to sneak away from the factory floor where there is cctv by the way and find a corner where at eleven o'clock at night he can call his girlfriend
StefanaBroadbent_2009G-0024883-0025660 their children back in the philippines was telling me about how much parenting is going on through skype and how much
StefanaBroadbent_2009G-0036477-0037318 if you think nursery kindergarten first years of school are just dedicated to take away the children to make them used to staying long hours away from their family
StefanaBroadbent_2009G-0048598-0049218 access at work is actually doing private email from his office i really think that the number is conservative
StefanoMancuso_2010G-0006048-0006463 or at least for a very long period and no one is taking care of plants
StefanoMancuso_2010G-0020611-0021599 when he speaks about animals tends to remove the fact that plants exist the blue whale the biggest creature that exists on the planet that
StefanoMancuso_2010G-0032499-0033097 they are also able to play they are really playing these are young
StefanoMancuso_2010G-0049089-0049726 big man charles darwin publishes a wonderful astonishing book that
StefanoMancuso_2010G-0061074-0062138 the signals that you are seeing here are action potential are the same signals that the neurons of my brain of our brain use to exchange information
StefanoMancuso_2010G-0067463-0068358 to survive predation they work in the same way so you can remove ninety percent of the root apparatus and the plants
StefanoMancuso_2010G-0073907-0074806 any plantoid well if you want to fly it's good that you look at birds to be inspired by birds but if you want
StefonHarris_2011S-0039998-0040997 or the past you really are alive right here in this moment there are so many decisions being made when you walk on the bandstand we had no idea what key we were going to play
StephenColeman_2011X-0001614-0003504 to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the western world australia united states u k and so on face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things that we've sent australian military personnel to in recent years
StephenColeman_2011X-0021089-0022485 another suggestion has been since we're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous they're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without a human in the loop
StephenColeman_2011X-0046651-0048328 and i went and had a look at some of the figures here now when they introduced o c spray in queensland they were really explicit the police minister had a whole heap of public statements made about it they were saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting
StephenColeman_2011X-0077473-0077999 the problem with that is that it's seen that sometimes non lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative
StephenHawking_2008-0003438-0003622 are we alone in the universe
StephenHawking_2008-0008873-0009311 why did the universe emerge from the big bang the way it did
StephenHawking_2008-0013682-0014166 however this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions
StephenHawking_2008-0020032-0020348 we think we have solved the mystery of creation
StephenHawking_2008-0029935-0030218 on the other hand we don't seem to have
StephenHawking_2008-0041725-0042430 it will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years let alone the next thousand or
StephenHawking_2008-0054179-0054483 and really gave me an insight into the incredible
StephenLawler_2007-0009761-0010836 so virtual earth is about you know starting off creating the first digital representation comprehensive of the entire world what we want to do is mix in all types of data
StephenLawler_2007-0019013-0019351 so a little unknown secret is did you see the one with the
StephenLawler_2007-0029195-0030476 we think about the user interface what does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives an ortho view a nadir view how do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery while maintaining the fluidity of the model
StephenPalumbi_2010Z-0004779-0005632 and if we just take that and we build from there then we can go to the next step which is that if the ocean ain't happy
StephenPalumbi_2010Z-0023009-0023572 no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pile of
StephenPalumbi_2010Z-0037765-0038539 and identify what they really were and some of those whale meat samples were whale meat some of them were illegal whale meat by the way that's another story
StephenPalumbi_2010Z-0048805-0049816 even though they're still selling whale meat which i believe they shouldn't but at least it's labeled correctly and you're no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead
StephenPalumbi_2010Z-0063508-0064572 swamped by human sewage but beaches are closed a lot in our country they're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason and i believe we shouldn't tolerate that either
StephenPalumbi_2010Z-0077595-0078215 is being blocked and clogged what do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow well there's a bunch of things you could do
StephenPalumbi_2010Z-0090141-0091134 the fortunes of monterey bay but other places around the world well i want to leave you with the thought that what we're really trying to do here is protect this ocean pyramid
StephenPetranek_2002-0014449-0014688 which leads me to a videotape
StephenPetranek_2002-0026461-0027282 people around the world are getting better medicine but mentally we're falling apart the world health
StephenPetranek_2002-0033926-0034536 this is a curable disease with present medicine and present technology but it is often a combination
StephenPetranek_2002-0041943-0042361 all of the ones we've found by the way are in this little teeny tiny corner where we live in the milky way
StephenPetranek_2002-0057297-0058027 last forever our sun doesn't last forever if we want humanity to last forever we have to colonize the milky way
StephenPetranek_2002-0071069-0071895 this is the most important thing this is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about secondly we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet and start moving them around
StephenPetranek_2002-0087760-0088368 that creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer you may of heard of it heard it called starling
StephenPetranek_2002-0101342-0102326 thousand years since this happened so it should have happened about four hundred and eighty thousand years ago oh and here's one other thing scientists think now our magnetic field may be
StephenPetranek_2002-0113354-0113583 they go through periods of diminishment when
StephenPetranek_2002-0124845-0125556 mutates and we know staph can do amazing things a staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes
StephenPetranek_2002-0139502-0140470 the chances that one would actually hit us is fairly remote but it only has to get close about a billion miles away
StephenPetranek_2002-0154990-0155661 the folks at the sloan digital sky survey told us last fall they're making the first map of the universe three dimensional map of the universe
StephenPetranek_2002-0166808-0167931 we need to figure out how to blow up an asteroid or alter its trajectory now a year ago we did an amazing thing we sent a probe out to this asteroid belt called near near earth asteroid rendezvous
StephenRitz_2012X-0005816-0006408 the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet so i get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm that i'm hoping to share with you all today
StephenRitz_2012X-0028086-0029361 really had the skills he needed to build affordable housing for new yorkers right in their own neighborhood and this is what my kids are doing making living wage now if you're like me you live in a building there are seven guys out of work looking to manage a million dollars i don't
StephenRitz_2012X-0064648-0065052 forty percent attendance to ninety three percent attendance all start
StephenWolfram_2010-0006271-0007067 and how they could be automated as much as possible eventually i created a whole structure based on symbolic programming and so on that let me build mathematica
StephenWolfram_2010-0019377-0020086 this science is different more general than the mathematics based science that we've had for the past three hundred or so years
StephenWolfram_2010-0032254-0033425 so i decided to just try to see how much of the systematic knowledge that's out there in the world we can make computable so it's been a big very complex project which i was not sure was going to work at all
StephenWolfram_2010-0039955-0040797 the idea is that we can sort of just type this in this kind of question in however we think of it so let's try asking a question like a health related question
StephenWolfram_2010-0046235-0046984 and to try and be an authoritative source in all areas to be able to compute answers to specific questions that people have not
StephenWolfram_2010-0056059-0057329 and of course now with wolfram alpha actually out in the wild we can learn from its actual usage and in fact there's been an interesting coevolution that's been going on between wolfram alpha and its human
StephenWolfram_2010-0067973-0068839 mathematica to know what to do here well then on the other hand we have wolfram alpha with all the sort of messiness of the world and human language and so on built into it
StephenWolfram_2010-0078530-0079647 well it turns out we can do very much the same kind of thing in the computational universe there's an inexhaustible supply of programs out there the challenge is to see how to harness them for human purposes
StephenWolfram_2010-0094521-0095271 here's the problem any serious candidate for our universe is inevitably full of computational irreducibility
StephenWolfram_2010-0110553-0111511 the things that people have tried to do in the last twenty five years or so with string theory and so on have been an interesting exploration that has tried to get back to the standard model but hasn't quite
SteveKeil_2011X-0002107-0002290 now before you get up in arms
SteveKeil_2011X-0011693-0012542 and this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies we hire the most people we create the most taxes
SteveKeil_2011X-0027725-0029293 and here's how it works step one woman says i want to have a baby iskam baby step two we get the baby woohoo but then what happens in step three i want to go back to work because i need to further my career or i just want to go have coffees i'm going to give bebko to baba
SteveKeil_2011X-0043549-0043875 well i'm going to say no and i will prove it to you
SteveKeil_2011X-0052616-0052885 dolphins pretty big brains play a lot
SteveKeil_2011X-0062991-0063287 little exercise just for a second close your eyes
SteveKeil_2011X-0076153-0077018 not worse but better and when customers call for service and they're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled how do the customers feel they feel great
SteveKeil_2011X-0087943-0089847 if you don't believe me well just go home and think about it some more or something second of all if you don't have the feeling of play in you you need to rediscover play whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy that you enjoyed only six months ago but now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy because you feel like you have to be serious rediscover it
SteveKeil_2011X-0104403-0105629 about how play promotes a sense of promise and self fulfillment of how play promotes innovation and productivity and ultimately how play creates meaning
SteveRamirez_2013X-0014727-0015387 so yeah this task does seem to be daunting but luckily we got help from the brain itself
SteveRamirez_2013X-0026341-0027080 so you are looking at the crystallization of the fleeting formation of fear you're actually looking at the cross section of a memory right now
SteveRamirez_2013X-0047341-0047892 those kinds of fleeting thoughts that physically incapacitate you that temporarily give you that deer in headlights look
SteveRamirez_2013X-0077732-0078544 and now the animal suddenly freezes it's as though it's recalling being mildly shocked in this environment even though that never actually happened
SteveTruglia_2009G-0010657-0011175 my favorite and a real hero of mine is yakima canutt yakima canutt really formed the
SteveTruglia_2009G-0031210-0032501 i sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are the next thing that i'd like to show you is something that dunlop asked me to do earlier this year with our channel five's fifth gear show a loop the loop biggest in the world only one person had ever done it before
SteveTruglia_2009G-0044880-0046117 and this is a guinness world record attempt they asked me open their fiftieth anniversary show in two thousand and four and again technology meant that i could do the fastest abseil over one hundred meters and stop within a couple of feet of the ground
SteveTruglia_2009G-0067240-0068025 the little black dots are people it's hundreds of feet high it's enormous that's in new mexico that's the u s air force museum
SteveTruglia_2009G-0082172-0083320 this is a very lightweight suit it weighs about fifteen pounds it's next to nothing especially designed for me it's a working prototype i will use it for all the jumps would you just give us a little twirl please costa thank you very much
StevenAddis_2012-0007376-0007770 no one's ever refused and luckily no one's ever run off with our camera
StevenAddis_2012-0011420-0011862 because while we take the same photo our perspectives change
StevenAddis_2012-0014902-0015077 on our earlier trips
StevenCowley_2009G-0003117-0003988 that that's why the sun shines i've always been very worried about resource i don't know about you but when my mother gave me food
StevenCowley_2009G-0017690-0018673 but if you wanted to know what the perfect energy source is the perfect energy source is one that doesn't take up much space has a virtually inexhaustible supply
StevenCowley_2009G-0031912-0032817 if you can get something to about one hundred and fifty million degrees things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration
StevenCowley_2009G-0046410-0047225 as current electricity so how would we make it we have to hold something at one hundred and fifty million degrees and in fact
StevenJohnson_2003-0002746-0003386 basically emergence was published on nine eleven i live right there
StevenJohnson_2003-0018177-0019063 and the west village had never seemed more lively i walked up along hudson street where jane jacobs had lived and written her great book that so influenced what i was writing in emergence
StevenJohnson_2003-0030639-0031420 no single person is really the ultimate kind of actor behind the personality of a neighborhood same thing to the question of who was keeping the streets alive
StevenJohnson_2003-0038761-0040170 and you know i don't want to belittle that that in a sense to reference you know what jeff was talking about yesterday that was in a sense the kind of interface electricity that powered a lot of the explosion of interest in the web that you could put up a link and somebody could click on it and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go
StevenJohnson_2003-0044795-0045983 it's just that there's so many other people in your navel when you gaze because effectively what's happening here what's creating this page obviously and we all know this but it's worth just thinking about it is not some
StevenJohnson_2003-0064324-0065691 and one of the things that i experimented with is this thing called google share which is basically you take an abstract term and you search google for that term and then you search the results that you get back for somebody's name
StevenJohnson_2003-0086255-0087501 this is basically the distribution of links on the web to all these various different blogs it follows a power law so that there are a few extremely well linked to popular blogs
StevenJohnson_2006S-0003585-0004628 and tell the story in brief of this outbreak which in many ways i think helped create the world that we live in today and particularly the kind of city that we live in today
StevenJohnson_2006S-0014032-0014863 so you would just walk around in london at this point and just be overwhelmed with this stench and what ended up happening is that an entire
StevenJohnson_2006S-0027666-0028850 how cultural change happens how a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas and snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody kind of ignored and then on one day
StevenJohnson_2006S-0042739-0043789 and eventually snow made a map of the outbreak he found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick people who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick
StevenJohnson_2006S-0056696-0057486 but because of what snow did because of this map because of the whole series of kind of reforms that happened in the wake of this map we now take for granted
StevenJohnson_2010G-0012254-0013656 and share it was a space as matt ridley talked about where ideas could have sex this was their conjugal bed in a sense ideas would get together there and an astonishing number of innovations from this period have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story
StevenJohnson_2010G-0027233-0028218 so the metaphor i'd like the use i can take from a story of a great idea that's quite recent a lot more recent than the sixteen fifties
StevenJohnson_2010G-0051707-0051973 what happened actually when dunbar kind of looked at the tape
StevenJohnson_2010G-0065835-0066768 from the period before he has this epiphany and so what you realize is that darwin in a sense had the idea he had the concept but was unable of fully thinking it yet
StevenJohnson_2010G-0079541-0080634 if we tune in and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues and everybody's like no i hadn't thought of doing that that's an interesting idea and it turns out weiffenbach is kind of an expert in microwave
StevenJohnson_2010G-0095480-0096566 it's really hard to figure out how to get your missile so that it will land right on top of moscow if you don't know where the submarine is in the middle of the pacific ocean so we're thinking we could throw up a bunch of satellites
StevenLevitt_2004-0002412-0002509 so if you
StevenLevitt_2004-0013193-0014085 so let me start by talking about crack cocaine and how it transformed the gang and to do that you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine in the early eighties and look at
StevenLevitt_2004-0020971-0021331 crack cocaine was the extra chunky version of
StevenLevitt_2004-0025795-0026433 didn't know it wanted crack cocaine but when it came it really did and it was a perfect drug you could sell for
StevenLevitt_2004-0043131-0043391 found out is in fact that the real answer was the following
StevenLevitt_2004-0053077-0054384 what do we find in the gang well let me say one thing we really got access to everybody in the gang we got an inside look at the gang from the very bottom up to the very top they trusted sudhir
StevenLevitt_2004-0065460-0066321 gangs the four square block by four square block areas they're just like the guys in some sense who are running the mcdonald's they are the entrepreneurs they get
StevenLevitt_2004-0078947-0080296 in these communities this is what they were striving for they weren't trying to make it in legitimate ways because there were no legitimate channels out this was the best way out and it actually was the right choice probably to try to make it out
StevenLevitt_2004-0089686-0090355 if you look at the death rates just of random young black males growing up in the inner city in the united states the death rates
StevenLevitt_2004-0098502-0099271 so there are striking similarities i think to the internet boom right the first set of people in silicon valley got very very rich and then all of my friends
StevenLevitt_2004-0109149-0109320 i hadn't thought i'd have time to do
StevenLevitt_2005G-0004238-0005155 it was free virtually free and was very easy to use but the worst thing about it was that you couldn't use it on the youngest children on infants and on one year olds
StevenLevitt_2005G-0014962-0016388 they heard her story and the other people and they said yeah you're right we should make a law we should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment and not let anybody use this on their children and the people were happy they were satisfied for many years this went along and everything was fine
StevenLevitt_2005G-0027514-0028388 and the expensive cure the three hundred million dollar a year cure is child car seats and what i'd like to talk to you about today is some of the evidence
StevenLevitt_2005G-0041497-0042621 ok so the highest bar is what you're striving to beat so you can control for the basic things like how hard the crash was what seat the child was sitting in et cetera the age of the child
StevenLevitt_2005G-0059692-0060555 under the conditions of anonymity they said they would be happy to do this test for us so anonymity and one thousand five hundred dollars per seat that we crashed
StevenLevitt_2005G-0076966-0078193 you can see that it takes much longer with the car seat at rebound it takes a lot longer but there's just a lot less movement for child who's in the seatbelt so i'll show you the six year old crashes as well the six year old's in a car seat and
StevenLevitt_2005G-0094857-0095192 he still convinced they were not sick had another jar of pills
StevenLevitt_2005G-0106405-0107288 that's a great question in my data and in another data set i've looked at for new jersey crashes i find very small differences in injury
StevenPetranek_2002-0006133-0007995 after a hard day of work and start talking about some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works and they would inevitably end up in what i thought was a very bizarre place which is ways the world could end very suddenly and that's what i want to talk about
StevenPetranek_2002-0029976-0030932 allow us to think of one hundred as a normal lifespan a female child born tomorrow on average median
StevenPetranek_2002-0045453-0045755 life does not exist elsewhere
StevenPetranek_2002-0063991-0065513 we have lost twenty five percent of the unique species in hawaii in the last twenty years california is expected to lose twenty five percent of its species in the next forty years somewhere in the amazon forest is the marginal tree
StevenPetranek_2002-0083717-0084226 we need the advice of particle physicists to talk about particle physics
StevenPetranek_2002-0109577-0110708 our magnetic field has done pretty well protecting us from this occasionally we get a flare from the sun that causes havoc with communications and so forth and electricity
StevenPetranek_2002-0126248-0127094 the danger is that some germ like staph will be will mutate into something that's really virulent very contagious and will sweep
StevenPetranek_2002-0161969-0162521 nasa's spending three million dollars a year three million bucks that is like pocket change
StevenPinker_2003-0003728-0004776 all of its structure comes from socialization culture parenting experience the blank slate was an influential idea in the twentieth century here are a few
StevenPinker_2003-0018005-0018715 measured the distribution of gray matter that is the outer layer of the cortex in a large sample
StevenPinker_2003-0032099-0032713 and both of them liked to surprise people by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump
StevenPinker_2003-0045395-0046396 profit from the lessons of history so even if people did have impulses towards selfishness or greed that's not the only thing in the skull and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them
StevenPinker_2003-0058963-0059722 but the data at the time seemed to support that well pretty soon they were barraged with enraged letters
StevenPinker_2003-0070970-0071846 music dance poetry found in all cultures and many of the motifs and themes that
StevenPinker_2003-0084477-0085176 the only grain of truth to this complaint that the arts are in decline come from three spheres
StevenPinker_2003-0103523-0103920 to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition convergence
StevenPinker_2003-0115278-0116033 most studies of parenting on which this advice is based are useless they're useless because they don't control for heritability
StevenPinker_2003-0122216-0123039 wrong identical twins or any siblings who are separated at birth are no less similar than if they had grown up together
StevenPinker_2003-0130293-0131491 are going to increasingly in the years to come upset various dogmas careers and deeply held political belief systems and that presents us with a choice the choice is whether
StevenPinker_2005G-0014143-0014938 indulge me in my passion for verbs and how they're used the problem is which verbs go in which constructions
StevenPinker_2005G-0029652-0030639 how are these construals reflected in language well in both cases the thing that is construed as being affected is expressed as the direct object the noun after the verb
StevenPinker_2005G-0045677-0046539 the container metaphor of communication in which we conceive of ideas as objects sentences as containers and communication as a kind of sending
StevenPinker_2005G-0056986-0057829 take seriously the fact that so much of our verbiage about abstract events is based on a concrete metaphor it would see human intelligence itself
StevenPinker_2005G-0074761-0075550 now relationships types can be negotiated even though there are default situations in which one of these mindsets can be applied
StevenPinker_2005G-0089038-0090199 if you express your request as a conditional if you could open the window that would be great even though the content is an imperative the fact that you're not using the imperative voice means that you're not
StevenPinker_2007-0001319-0001642 images like this from the auschwitz concentration camp
StevenPinker_2007-0008287-0009473 and seldom resulted in indiscriminate or wholesale slaughter now you're all familiar with this treacle we teach it to our children we hear it on television and in story books now
StevenPinker_2007-0018888-0019655 here is a graph that he put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of
StevenPinker_2007-0033866-0034567 social history will reveal that mutilation and torture were routine forms of criminal punishment the kind of infraction today that would give you
StevenPinker_2007-0044664-0045707 seven or eight european countries then there is a slight uptick in the nineteen sixties the people who said that rock n roll would lead to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that
StevenPinker_2007-0059726-0060861 there are dynamics in the opinion and advocacy markets no one ever attracted observers advocates and donors by saying things just seem to be getting better and better
StevenPinker_2007-0071911-0072706 being a good american he has a pistol in the nightstand pulls out his gun and walks down the stairs and what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand
StevenPinker_2007-0083859-0085084 also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence in zones of anarchy in failed states collapsed empires frontier regions mafias street gangs and so on
StevenPinker_2007-0098972-0100064 the question is if this has happened what has powered that expansion and there are a number of possibilities increasing circles of reciprocity in the sense that robert wright argues for
StevenPinker_2007-0110549-0111494 in wright's theory that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation over larger and larger circles but also i think it helps us
StevenSchwaitzberg_2012X-0004034-0004710 now nobody wants an operation who here has had surgery
StevenSchwaitzberg_2012X-0010269-0010860 and taking instruments and watching it on a tv screen so let's see what it looks like
StevenSchwaitzberg_2012X-0031063-0031507 but for this examination which is really hard
StevenSchwaitzberg_2012X-0044965-0046287 accurately and in a cost effective fashion using technology and it has to be bi directional they have to be able to teach us something as well it's a big task
StevenSchwaitzberg_2012X-0066214-0067817 as we think about intersecting technologies everybody has a cell phone with a camera we could use this everywhere whether it be health care patient care engineering law conferencing translating videos this is a ubiquitous tool
StevenStrogatz_2004-0009810-0010937 is that what enabled you to synchronize so to put the question a little more seriously let's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did for spontaneous synchronization
StevenStrogatz_2004-0025614-0026533 that shows how swarms work there are just three simple rules first all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors
StevenStrogatz_2004-0034781-0035400 each individual is acting to cooperate what's really going on is a kind of selfish darwinian behavior
StevenStrogatz_2004-0050260-0051537 there's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies you can see it every night along the river banks the trees mangrove trees are filled with fireflies communicating with light
StevenStrogatz_2004-0068511-0068771 sort of like the way you clapped initially
StevenStrogatz_2004-0074991-0075282 there's no reason for them to synchronize and they probably won't
StevenStrogatz_2004-0084884-0085531 right so before any one goes out of sync i'll just put those right
StevenStrogatz_2004-0096919-0097296 so i want to first show you some interviews
StevenStrogatz_2004-0117529-0117784 this was to be the focus of the investigation
StevenStrogatz_2004R-0004144-0004902 notice by the way that when you applauded that you did it in a typical north american way that is you were raucous and incoherent
StevenStrogatz_2004R-0013413-0014182 it's real in fact i'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of if not
StevenStrogatz_2004R-0025460-0025850 a computer model made by ian kuzan a researcher at oxford
StevenStrogatz_2004R-0030475-0030692 all this changes when a predator enters the scene
StevenStrogatz_2004R-0035754-0036190 each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers
StevenStrogatz_2004R-0045932-0046598 we don't however really understand at a mathematical level i'm a mathematician we would like to be able to understand better
StevenStrogatz_2004R-0060210-0061451 you know a human being's tendency to see patterns where there are none but i hope you've convinced yourself now with this nighttime video that they really were very well synchronized okay well the issue then is do we need to be alive
StevenStrogatz_2004R-0069135-0069282 but if you were a laser
StevenStrogatz_2004R-0080155-0080455 how can they communicate i'm going to put them on a movable platform
StevenStrogatz_2004R-0087432-0088447 the millennium bridge was supposed to be the pride of london a beautiful new footbridge erected across the thames first river crossing in over one hundred years in london
StevenStrogatz_2004R-0098822-0099116 yeah it felt unstable and it was very windy
StevenStrogatz_2004R-0108247-0108628 now you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome but after all we do
StevenStrogatz_2004R-0119374-0119756 this yes this simulated bridge and this you reckon mimics the action of the real bridge
StewBLACKMENSKI_2006-0006738-0006959 we don't resemble in the
StewBLACKMENSKI_2006-0019901-0020181 everyone's a sex machine a a so
StewartBrand_2004-0004555-0004969 of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter
StewartBrand_2004-0010756-0010947 so the design problem for today
StewartBrand_2004-0019660-0020532 and we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain so we got looking in the dry areas of the southwest we looked at mesas in new mexico
StewartBrand_2004-0028900-0029182 which is eleven thousand six hundred feet on top
StewartBrand_2004-0044236-0044279 and then
StewartBrand_2004-0049070-0049238 turns out that mount washington
StewartBrand_2004-0056592-0057377 and came to the realization that he put in an article in science magazine called longevity under adversity in conifers
StewartBrand_2004-0073409-0074179 the whole mine it's a mile deep and they also found four species of bats in there now almost all those mines by the way meet underneath the mountain
StewartBrand_2004-0085935-0086098 it actually presents a problem
StewartBrand_2004-0094419-0095595 now i happened to be on the radio with alexander when he got to this point at the base of the cliffs and he said quote there's a hidden notch i think i can get up a ways
StewartBrand_2004-0106431-0107300 and so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth you can get another angle on danny's porch by going around to the south
StewartBrand_2004-0113296-0114577 at the edge of the cliffs it's six hundred foot just about a yard to the left of kurt bollacker's foot there is a six hundred foot drop he's ambling on over to zander's siq that's what it looks like looking down
StewartBrand_2004-0124813-0124888 also hard
StewartBrand_2004-0132048-0133081 could have an entrance which was very rough and narrow as you first went in that gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite and this stone takes a perfect polish
StewartBrand_2006-0005794-0006750 and the city air makes you free they said in renaissance germany so some people go to places like shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule
StewartBrand_2009S-0008736-0009811 it's interesting because history is driven to a large degree by the size of cities the developing world now has all of the biggest cities and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries
StewartBrand_2009S-0022584-0023704 a lot of people who think about all these poor people oh there's terrible things we've got to fix their housing it used to be oh we've got to get them phone service now they're showing us how they do their phone service famine mostly is a rural
StewartBrand_2009S-0040818-0041609 and head to town and when they're gone the natural environment starts to come back very rapidly and those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops
StewartBrand_2009S-0055529-0056139 electricity coal some gas nuclear and hydro
StewartBrand_2009S-0073579-0074501 why ten percent of the electricity in this room twenty percent of electricity in this room is probably nuclear half of that is coming from dismantled
StewartBrand_2009S-0087375-0087680 what body is going to decide
StewartBrand_2013-0005644-0006220 and indeed it was a keystone species that enriched the entire eastern deciduous forest
StewartBrand_2013-0010062-0010620 this made people realize that the same thing was about to happen to the american bison and so these birds
StewartBrand_2013-0019939-0020160 sorrow anger
StewartBrand_2013-0035208-0035565 it's been doing that since two thousand and five and it's likely to continue
StewartBrand_2013-0051020-0051686 so what they're doing is working with seven breeds of primitive hardy looking cattle like that maremmana primitivo on the top there
StewartBrand_2013-0060722-0062011 cryopreservation pioneer of great depth is oliver ryder at the san diego zoo his frozen zoo has collected the tissues from over one thousand species over the last thirty five years
StewartBrand_2013-0087894-0088284 that's how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors
StewartBrand_2013-0100006-0100306 but some species that we killed
StuartBrown_2008P-0005557-0005736 this is a courtyard in europe
StuartBrown_2008P-0015037-0015405 no claws extended no fangs taking a look
StuartBrown_2008P-0022150-0022982 to the importance of play in that this individual by deep study was found to have severe play deprivation charles whitman was his name
StuartBrown_2008P-0032974-0033754 for us humans and so now i'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play but it's never just
StuartBrown_2008P-0046411-0047212 has to be safe exploration this happens to be ok he's an anatomically interested little boy and that's his mom other situations wouldn't be quite so
StuartBrown_2008P-0059229-0059454 so what does play do for the brain
StuartBrown_2008P-0070662-0070999 to play at a certain period of their juvenile years
StuartBrown_2008P-0076820-0076882 this is a
StuartBrown_2008P-0087043-0087892 groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals you may not know this word
StuartBrown_2008P-0096917-0097702 force over his entire life now there's another play history that i think is a work in progress
StuartBrown_2008P-0103182-0103388 i think as he now is
StuartBrown_2008P-0112230-0112996 this is our maiden voyage in this we're about two and a half three months into it and it's really been fun there is our star
StuartBrown_2008P-0128872-0130300 the wearable meeting because when you put it on you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting but when you take it off that's when the real action happens
StuartBrown_2008P-0146215-0147045 and the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear or you and i and our dogs can crossover and have that
StuartFirestein_2013-0003191-0004470 trying to figure out what shape this might be what that might be there are reports of a cat somewhere around they may not be reliable they may be and so forth and so on now i know this is different than the way most people think about science
StuartFirestein_2013-0024906-0026733 of our courses and leaving out of the interaction that we have with the public as scientists the what remains to be done this is the stuff that's exhilarating and interesting it is if you will the ignorance that's what was missing so i thought well maybe i should teach a course on ignorance
StuartFirestein_2013-0040623-0041922 you need to know a lot of stuff to be a lawyer or an accountant or an electrician or a carpenter but in science knowing a lot of stuff is not the point knowing a lot of stuff is there to help you get
StuartFirestein_2013-0053938-0055591 as it turns out he kind of cribbed that from the philosopher immanuel kant who a hundred years earlier had come up with this idea of question propagation that every answer begets more questions i love that term question propagation this idea of questions propagating out there
StuartFirestein_2013-0074361-0075380 we have pattern recognition all of these sorts of things they work differently than our visual systems in some cases but nonetheless we've been pretty good at making a technology work like our visual system
StuartFirestein_2013-0090204-0092034 in the age of google and wikipedia the business model of the university and probably secondary schools is simply going to have to change we just can't sell facts for a living anymore they're available with a click of the mouse or if you want to you could probably just ask the wall one of these days wherever they're going to hide the things that tell us all this stuff
StuartFirestein_2013-0100979-0102953 so we always will get what we screen for and part of what we screen for is in our testing methods well we hear a lot about testing and evaluation and we have to think carefully when we're testing whether we're evaluating or whether we're weeding whether we're weeding people out whether we're making some cut
SueAustin_2012X-0014556-0014975 by creating unexpected images
SueAustin_2012X-0049534-0050541 and i think that moment of completely new thought perhaps creates a freedom that spreads to the rest of other people's lives
SugataMitra_2007P-0008454-0009717 you get to remoter areas what happens to education the second or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world
SugataMitra_2007P-0021612-0022446 but what happened was that when i administered a questionnaire to each of these schools with one single question for the teachers which was would you like to move
SugataMitra_2007P-0039302-0040111 puts the teacher into a tough bind you have to think anyway so i'm proposing that an alternative primary education whatever alternative you want
SugataMitra_2007P-0052985-0054235 so it sort of raised more questions than it answered is this real does the language matter because he's not supposed to know english will the computer last or will they break it and steal it and did anyone
SugataMitra_2007P-0061291-0062139 that and the internet explorer changed page eight minutes later he looked from his hand to the screen
SugataMitra_2007P-0069909-0070963 and i built a similar hole in the wall one big difference in the villages as opposed to the urban slums there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk in the urban slums
SugataMitra_2007P-0082634-0083391 so i needed different climates for which india is also great because we have very cold very hot and so on this is the desert to the west
SugataMitra_2007P-0094562-0095589 leave it at that because i mean it sort of says it all doesn't it what could they learn to do basic windows functions browsing painting chatting and email
SugataMitra_2007P-0105517-0106216 so that was and the second bit that i wanted to tell you that children can self organize and attain an educational objective
SugataMitra_2007P-0120795-0121793 not meant for education it was meant for making board room presentations we borrowed it video conferencing the personal computer itself i think it's time that the educationists made their own specs
SugataMitra_2010G-0009186-0009951 but i repeated this all over india and then through a large part of the world and noticed that
SugataMitra_2010G-0022129-0022978 two months later and this is now documented in the information technology for international development journal that accents had changed
SugataMitra_2010G-0032930-0032991 the adults
SugataMitra_2010G-0045136-0045685 them with it i came back after two months and the twenty six children marched in looking very very quiet i said
SugataMitra_2010G-0057676-0058340 she said what's that i said well what you've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time
SugataMitra_2010G-0070500-0071262 after two months the score was seventy six percent there was photographic
SugataMitra_2010G-0085808-0086618 in may i sent all the teachers away from my group of ten year old students i speak only english they speak
SugataMitra_2013-0003062-0003277 which kind of sets the stage
SugataMitra_2013-0008766-0009355 it's still with us today it's called the bureaucratic administrative machine
SugataMitra_2013-0014297-0014561 and ship them to canada and he would be instantly functional
SugataMitra_2013-0020864-0021346 and you have people who guide those computers to do their clerical jobs
SugataMitra_2013-0026738-0027238 at the same time we also had lots of parents rich people who had computers
SugataMitra_2013-0034107-0034475 one of your students must have been passing by showed them how to use the mouse
SugataMitra_2013-0044972-0045128 so i started publishing
SugataMitra_2013-0058134-0058777 the children came rushing said what's all this so i said it's very topical very important
SugataMitra_2013-0071721-0071926 well wow i mean how did you do that
SugataMitra_2013-0082588-0082762 and become homo sapiens
SugataMitra_2013-0086783-0087751 punishment and examinations are seen as threats we take our children we make them shut their brains down and then we say perform
SugataMitra_2013-0094997-0095562 in northwestern england deep inside a village in tamil nadu india
SugataMitra_2013-0112896-0113370 the way you would put it to a nine year old is to say if a meteorite was coming to hit the earth
SugataMitra_2013-0119958-0121449 because you know it's very important my wish is to help design a future of learning by supporting children all over the world to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together help me build this school it will be called the school in the cloud
SuheirHammad_2010W-0003724-0004047 hunted stolen stretched
SuheirHammad_2010W-0014872-0015753 but i'm going to need you to just sit for like ten minutes and hold a woman who is not here hold her now
SuheirHammad_2010W-0025061-0026227 everything is everything one woman loses fifteen maybe twenty members of her family one woman loses six one woman loses her head one woman searches rubble
SunithaKrishnan_2009I-0004295-0005050 mother was a woman in prostitution a prostituted person she got infected with hiv
SunithaKrishnan_2009I-0024620-0025626 you have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked i had this i s officer's daughter who is fourteen years old
SunithaKrishnan_2009I-0038242-0038951 to get raped by one hundred men a day and it's abnormal to live in a shelter it's abnormal to
SunithaKrishnan_2009I-0049371-0050276 crossed the barrier of it and therefore they could fight in a male dominated world very easily and not feel very shy about it
SunithaKrishnan_2009I-0055625-0056304 my biggest challenge is society it's you and me
SunithaKrishnan_2009I-0063496-0064417 they need your compassion they need your empathy they need much more than anything else your acceptance
SunniBrown_2011-0006364-0007220 in the nineteenth century it was a corrupt politician and today we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition at least to me which is the following
SunniBrown_2011-0024253-0025968 the incredible contribution of the doodle is that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously with the possibility of an emotional experience that is a pretty solid contribution for a behavior equated with doing nothing this is so nerdy but this made me cry when i discovered this
SusanBlackmore_2008-0004428-0004806 that i suggest is the view that comes out of taking memetics seriously
SusanBlackmore_2008-0017976-0018916 had no concept of the idea of an algorithm but that's what he described in that book and this is what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm the principle is
SusanBlackmore_2008-0030011-0031035 and he wanted to get away from everybody thinking all the time about genes and so he said is there another replicator out there on the planet ah yes there is look around you
SusanBlackmore_2008-0042440-0043598 they're selfish information they will get copied if they can but some of them will be copied because they're good or true or useful or beautiful some of them will be copied even though they're not
SusanBlackmore_2008-0052508-0053845 imagine a world full of brains and far more memes than can possibly find homes the memes are all trying to get copied trying in inverted commas i e that's the shorthand for if they can get copied they will
SusanBlackmore_2008-0058584-0059901 the point of memetics is to say oh no it doesn't there are two replicators now on this planet from the moment that our ancestors perhaps two and a half million years ago or so began imitating
SusanBlackmore_2008-0065120-0066305 what turned out to be language competing to get the brains to get bigger and bigger so the big brain on this theory is driven by the memes this is why in the meme machine i called it memetic drive
SusanBlackmore_2008-0080209-0080641 so we're at this cusp now of having a third replicator on
SusanBlackmore_2008-0092254-0093266 we may take the gaian view i loved peter ward's talk yesterday it's not gaian all the time actually life forms produce things that kill themselves well we did pull through on this planet
SusanBlackmore_2008-0101652-0101800 and this is even more
SusanBlackmore_2008-0112427-0113108 is showing us how dangerous the third point is that third danger point getting a third replicator
SusanCain_2012-0015497-0015762 now i tell you this story about summer camp
SusanCain_2012-0030932-0032018 so if you picture the typical classroom nowadays when i was going to school we sat in rows we sat in rows of desks like this and we did most of our work pretty autonomously
SusanCain_2012-0048651-0049634 but many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other and what i'm saying is that culturally we need a much better balance we need more of a yin and yang between these two types
SusanCain_2012-0056039-0056204 now
SusanCain_2012-0063083-0064222 groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room even though there's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas i mean zero so
SusanCain_2012-0076349-0076759 so that's the world we're living in today that's our cultural inheritance
SusanCain_2012-0087090-0087726 and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the sixty two years that he was a rabbi
SusanCain_2012-0100660-0101144 number one stop the madness for constant group work just stop it
SusanLim_2010P-0005584-0005796 next raising the money
SusanLim_2010P-0018911-0019218 a submissive spouse an in law
SusanLim_2010P-0026049-0026206 and at each time
SusanLim_2010P-0037466-0037898 if there could be a better way a way to circumvent death
SusanLim_2010P-0048476-0048741 and this inspired a shift in my mindset
SusanLim_2010P-0064912-0065615 aging adult cells from you and me they are racing to reprogram these cells back into more useful
SusanLim_2010P-0072306-0072961 but stepping out of the elevator into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room i realized that my left
SusanLim_2010P-0089654-0089936 stem cells may one day herald
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004-0001614-0002055 happy most of the time because i think this is the happiest species on the planet
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004-0010686-0010888 there were tasmanians
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004-0017324-0017634 just at puberty about six or seven years of age
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004-0027076-0027261 one discovery was that
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004-0035411-0035686 i hope i have a lighter you can use the lighter to start the fire
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004-0045496-0045799 she knows that that individual in the mirror is her
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004-0060691-0061528 but difficult to handle requiring great skill kanzi's rock is from gona ethiopia and is identical to that used by our
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004-0074149-0074226 similar to
SusanSavageRumbaugh_2004-0084917-0085604 until nyota now one year old steals it then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth
SusanShaw_2010X-0003703-0004738 as it turns out marine mammals are at the top of this food chain that we're pouring millions of tons of toxic substances into every year
SusanShaw_2010X-0016087-0017235 and also then a phase out u s wide at the end of last year but we said well on the bright side our harbor seals at least will not be bursting into flame anytime soon
SusanShaw_2010X-0030367-0031347 and i did get sick i got a ferocious sore throat two days later i felt like my throat was on fire but it did pass
SusanShaw_2010X-0048992-0050370 so this is the way it works and i want to show you this cute little thing that happens here it's a micelle micelles form around the oil and what happens first is the solvents break into the oil
SusanShaw_2010X-0062146-0063239 so we did find that corexit nine thousand five hundred contains heavy metals arsenic and chromium arsenic at high enough levels to have cancer causing effects
SusanShaw_2010X-0073368-0074214 with oil alone there's ninety eight percent fertilization so they're a very sensitive species to this combo here's another group
SusanShaw_2010X-0085772-0086952 we started hypothesizing what do we know what do with think would be a trophic cascade which means that somebody gets wiped out and then everything above that's eating those guys will crash
SusanSolomon_2012G-0001766-0003661 embryonic stem cells are really incredible cells they are our body's own repair kits and they're pluripotent which means they can morph into all of the cells in our bodies soon we actually will be able to use stem cells to replace cells that are damaged or diseased
SusanSolomon_2012G-0019995-0021534 to actually do clinical trials in a dish with human cells not animal cells to generate drugs and treatments that are much more effective much safer much faster and at a much lower cost
SusanSolomon_2012G-0036883-0038099 and this opens up the ability which hopefully will become something that is routine in the near term of using human cells to test for drugs
SusanSolomon_2012G-0058896-0060671 there was a very sad example of this in the last decade there's a wonderful drug and a class of drugs actually but the particular drug was vioxx and for people who were suffering from severe arthritis pain the drug was an absolute lifesaver
SusanSolomon_2012G-0075871-0077573 is like looking at the ones and zeroes of the computer code without having a computer that can read it it's like having an app without having a smartphone we needed to have a way of bringing the biology to that incredible data
SuzanneLee_2011U-0001623-0002053 as a fashion designer i've always tended to think of materials something like this
SuzanneLee_2011U-0006466-0007256 and then while it's still hot add a couple of kilos of sugar we stir this in until it's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath
SuzanneLee_2011U-0020399-0021159 and using indigo make it anti microbial and in fact cotton would take up to eighteen
SvantePaabo_2011G-0006817-0008621 and we can then see the result of such mutations when we compare dna sequences among us here in the room for example if we compare my genome to the genome of you approximately every one thousand two hundred one thousand three hundred letters will differ between us
SvantePaabo_2011G-0031937-0032420 well we can begin to ask those questions also there is for example a project
SvantePaabo_2011G-0054220-0055264 most famously perhaps neanderthals these robust forms of humans compared to the left here with a modern human skeleton on the right
SvantePaabo_2011G-0071706-0073014 if they then mixed with each other there then those modern humans that became the ancestors of everyone outside africa carried with them this neanderthal component in their genome to the rest of the world
SvantePaabo_2011G-0087654-0089533 in the west there were neanderthals in the east there were denisovans maybe other forms of humans too that we've not yet described we don't know quite where the borders between these people were but we know that in southern siberia there were both neanderthals and denisovans at least at some time in the past
SylviaEarle_2009-0019626-0020756 then i've used about thirty kinds of submarines and i've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called deep search to design and build systems to access the deep sea
SylviaEarle_2009-0034330-0034654 yet we have this idea we humans that the earth
SylviaEarle_2009-0046577-0047320 we can flit over to hawaii and see the real hawaiian islands not just the little bit that pokes through the surface
SylviaEarle_2009-0062417-0063602 of these parts are part of our life support system we kill using long lines with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for fifty miles or more
SylviaEarle_2009-0085759-0086579 and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future such as the arctic we have one chance right now to get it right
SylviaEarle_2009-0096196-0097211 global plan of action with a world conservation union the iucn is underway to protect biodiversity to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change
SylviaEarle_2009-0107078-0107129 is the time
TBoonePickens_2012-0021856-0022067 raise your hand if you think you know
TBoonePickens_2012-0042095-0043856 and the opec nations are the ones that price the oil so where are we headed from here we're headed to natural gas natural gas will do everything we want it to do it's one hundred and thirty octane fuel
TBoonePickens_2012-0053386-0055032 you take eight million trucks these are eighteen wheelers and take them to natural gas reduce carbon by thirty percent it is cheaper and it will cut our imports three million barrels
TBoonePickens_2012-0065539-0066833 if we could do that i think we would take our first step to an energy plan if we did we could see that our own resources are easier to use than anybody can imagine thank you
TBoonePickens_2012-0093121-0093427 do not build a reformer on the ocean
TalGolesworthy_2011X-0001648-0002387 process engineer i know all about boilers and incinerators and fabric filters and cyclones and things
TalGolesworthy_2011X-0022359-0023254 we turn it into a solid plastic model as you can see using a rapid prototyping technique another engineering technique
TalGolesworthy_2011X-0043538-0043883 what was meant when a particular phrase was used
TaliSharot_2012-0003686-0005018 so we underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer being in a car accident we overestimate our longevity our career prospects in short we're more optimistic than realistic but we are oblivious to the fact
TaliSharot_2012-0020487-0020678 how attractive are you
TaliSharot_2012-0036820-0037484 in three hours in twenty four hours in three days in one year in ten years
TaliSharot_2012-0044232-0044806 surprise surprise saturday comes in at first then friday then sunday
TaliSharot_2012-0050574-0050832 it acts as a self fulfilling prophecy
TaliSharot_2012-0062363-0064038 but if someone started off saying my average likelihood of suffering from cancer is about ten percent and we said hey bad news the average likelihood is about thirty percent the next time around they would say yep still think it's about eleven percent
TaliSharot_2012-0076802-0077030 so we wanted to know
TaliSharot_2012-0087994-0088339 of course pitfalls and it would be really foolish of us to ignore them
TanLe_2010G-0004756-0005928 we observe facial expressions body language and we can intuit feelings and emotions from our dialogue with one another this actually forms a large part of our decision making process
TanLe_2010G-0017993-0018995 a technician will put the electrodes onto the scalp using a conductive gel or paste and usually after a procedure of preparing the scalp by light abrasion
TanLe_2010G-0035105-0036139 so once we accept this the cube is live so let's see if evan can actually try and imagine pulling
TanLe_2010G-0054654-0054847 you know from the user interface of the control
TanLe_2010G-0061545-0062377 we are really only scratching the surface of what is possible today and with the community's input and also with the involvement of developers and researchers
TanLe_2011X-0006648-0008126 a playwright a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country's unity and freedom imagine him as the communists enter saigon confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste
TanLe_2011X-0020257-0021333 and the first apple i tasted given to me by the men on the rig no apple has ever tasted the same
TanLe_2011X-0033116-0035055 she opened a computer store then studied to be a beautician and opened another business and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition angry and inflexible and troubled children caught between two worlds grants and sponsors were sought centers were established
TanLe_2011X-0049750-0051396 i have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that yes the world does fall apart but not in the way that you fear possibilities that would not have been allowed were outrageously encouraged there was an energy there an implacable optimism
TanLe_2011X-0067316-0067835 now i would like to have my own children and i wonder about the boat
TaniaLuna_2012S-0010852-0012240 so the first day we get to new york my grandmother and i find a penny in the floor of the homeless shelter that my family's staying in only we don't know that it's a homeless shelter we think that it's a hotel a hotel with lots of rats so
TaniaLuna_2012S-0023567-0024179 motels that would round up all of their food and keep it hostage until they were able to pay the bill
TarynSimon_2009G-0004812-0005677 and it read i'm just going to read a key sentence especially during these violent times i personally believe that the magical spell
TarynSimon_2009G-0016868-0017876 where there are over nineteen hundred stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste submerged in water a human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly
TarynSimon_2009G-0027845-0029433 standing in a room behind the mirror and they observe deliberations after mock trial proceedings so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy to have the outcome that they're hoping for this process costs sixty thousand dollars
TarynSimon_2009G-0042245-0043439 these are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the atlantic ocean connecting north america to europe they carry over sixty million simultaneous voice conversations
TarynSimon_2009G-0054567-0055995 and the majority of these white tigers are not born in a salable state and are killed at birth it's a very violent process that is little known and the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment
TarynSimon_2009G-0067943-0069260 however it's illegal to broadcast alhurra within the united states and in two thousand and four they developed a channel called alhurra iraq which specifically deals with events occurring in iraq and it is broadcast to iraq
TarynSimon_2009G-0082122-0082879 but the victim refused to press charges because she claimed that law enforcement had permanently altered her memory through the use of fredrick's photograph
TarynSimon_2009G-0094579-0095468 ronald jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a twenty eight year old woman i photographed him at the scene of arrest in chicago
TarynSimon_2011S-0003446-0003929 his brothers chandrabhan and phoolchand were also listed as dead
TarynSimon_2011S-0007902-0008663 he was laid to rest in the ganges river where the dead are cremated along the banks of the river or tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water
TarynSimon_2011S-0013974-0014997 the subjects i documented ranged from feuding families in brazil to victims of genocide in bosnia to the first woman to hijack an airplane and the living dead in india
TarynSimon_2011S-0028216-0029913 and these are studies commissioned by the zionist organization for alternative areas for jewish settlement in this i was interested in the consequences of geography and imagining how the world would be different if israel were in uganda which is what these maps demonstrate
TarynSimon_2011S-0043423-0044434 twenty four european rabbits were brought to australia in one thousand eight hundred and fifty nine by a british settler for sporting purposes for hunting and within
TarynSimon_2011S-0056079-0057346 she is followed by her four children all of whom were killed in the srebrenica massacre following those four children is zumra's younger sister who is then followed by her children who were killed as well
TarynSimon_2011S-0073882-0075181 the reasons for these absences include people who declined participation there's also parents who participated who wouldn't let their children participate because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves
TarynSimon_2011S-0086479-0087800 and the death of two mayors installed into a protective wall surrounding the suburban home of louis novaes who's the head of the novaes family are these turret holes which were used for shooting and looking
TarynSimon_2011S-0101847-0103029 and within this accumulation of images and texts i'm struggling to find patterns and imagine that the narratives that surround the lives we lead are just as coded as blood itself
TaviGevinson_2012X-0012662-0014126 i don't like to acknowledge a problem without also acknowledging those who work to fix it so just wanted to acknowledge shows like mad men movies like bridesmaids whose female characters or protagonists are complex multifaceted
TaviGevinson_2012X-0026018-0027375 girls then think that to be a feminist they have to live up to being perfectly consistent in your beliefs never being insecure never having doubts having all of the answers and this is not true and actually
TaylorWilson_2012-0001668-0003092 my name is taylor wilson i am seventeen years old and i am a nuclear physicist which may be a little hard to believe but i am and i would like to make the case that nuclear fusion will be that
TaylorWilson_2013-0001785-0002171 and this may be a little bit of a surprise to many of you who
TaylorWilson_2013-0023604-0024913 we don't need them anymore and what are we doing with all the waste essentially what are we doing with all the pits of those nuclear weapons well we're securing them and it would be great if we could burn them eat them up and this reactor loves this stuff
TaylorWilson_2013-0040371-0040992 and they're not going to have either nuclear material or radiological material proliferated from their cores
TaylorWilson_2013-0054341-0055503 say twenty years it's going to take us to get fusion and make fusion a reality this could be the source of energy that provides carbon free electricity carbon free electricity
TaylorWilson_2013-0066706-0067206 so i'm really excited i think that i've designed this reactor here that can
TempleGrandin_2010-0007820-0009157 now the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details okay this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters or pick out the little letters and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly
TempleGrandin_2010-0014904-0015808 and that's shown very very nicely in the movie in fact i loved the movie how they duplicated all my projects that's the geek side my drawings got to star in the movie
TempleGrandin_2010-0021035-0021898 more fort collins okay how about famous ones and they just kind of come up kind of like this just really quickly like google for pictures
TempleGrandin_2010-0035598-0036273 mind you see the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind good at one thing bad at something else
TempleGrandin_2010-0047870-0049313 and a man on the ground that is viewed as two totally different things you could have a horse that's been abused by a rider they will be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with the horse shoer but you can't ride him you have another horse where maybe the horse shoer beat him up
TempleGrandin_2010-0060783-0061561 and one of the things that is driving me really crazy as i travel around and i do autism meetings is i'm seeing a lot of smart geeky nerdy kids
TempleGrandin_2010-0076536-0077824 and let's talk about jobs okay my science teacher got me studying because i was a goof ball that didn't want to study but you know what i was getting work experience i'm seeing too many of these smart kids who haven't learned basic things like how to be on time
TempleGrandin_2010-0097832-0098922 know you once wrote i like this quote if by some magic autism had been eradicated from the face of the earth then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a
TempleGrandin_2010-0117009-0117031 thank
TerryMoore_2005-0001684-0002207 ted audience as a wonderful collection of some of the most effective intelligent intellectual
TerryMoore_2005-0014161-0014650 go the other way around the loop this is a little hard for children but i think you can handle
TerryMoore_2012-0014428-0016010 now in arabic we can make this definite by adding the definite article al so this is al shalan the unknown thing and this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics such as this tenth century derivation of proofs
ThandieNewton_2011G-0006695-0006947 the idea of self starts to form
ThandieNewton_2011G-0017347-0017614 and my mom is black from zimbabwe
ThandieNewton_2011G-0024635-0025124 and i was other before being anything else even before being a girl
ThandieNewton_2011G-0031407-0031967 it was the first time that i existed inside a fully functioning self
ThandieNewton_2011G-0040418-0041541 what is biological and scientific fact is that we all stem from africa in fact from a woman called mitochondrial eve who lived one hundred and sixty thousand years ago
ThandieNewton_2011G-0047399-0047941 we'd be right in assuming that the self is an actual living thing but it's not
ThandieNewton_2011G-0053451-0053688 in those moments i'm connected
ThandieNewton_2011G-0056341-0056533 so is divisiveness
ThandieNewton_2011G-0061975-0062216 the thing that was a source of shame
ThandieNewton_2011G-0071303-0071555 and use rape as a weapon of war
ThandieNewton_2011G-0078411-0078752 it's more a reality than the ones our selves have created

TheRaspyniBrothers_2002-0069235-0069799 an excerpt from a routine that we used to wipe out the other juggling team competition dh that's right
TheRaspyniBrothers_2002-0077492-0077548 it's
ThelmaGolden_2009-0003770-0004594 by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are jay jay from good times
ThelmaGolden_2009-0016391-0017768 to express the ways in which art could provide space for a dialogue complicated dialogue dialogue with many many points of entry and how the museum could be the space for this contest of ideas
ThelmaGolden_2009-0031433-0032504 harlem now sort of explaining and thinking of itself in this part of the century looking both backwards and forwards i always say harlem is an interesting community because unlike many other places
ThelmaGolden_2009-0047029-0048416 to this end the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions all titled with an f freestyle frequency and flow which have set out to discover and define
ThelmaGolden_2009-0062158-0063011 this generation has to say to the rest of us it's considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the world as their work travels
TheoJansen_2007-0001295-0001389 i would like to
TheoJansen_2007-0005431-0006081 forms of life on the beaches and they should survive over there on their own in the future
TheoJansen_2007-0010017-0010217 and walks in the opposite direction
TheoJansen_2007-0023677-0024499 it works the same as a wheel the axis of a wheel is staying on the same level and this hip is staying on the same level as well
TheoJansen_2007-0033621-0033854 big dangers is the sea this is the sea
TheoJansen_2007-0041567-0042074 it knows always where it is on the beach so it's very simple brain
TheyMightBeGiants_2007-0015482-0015843 i am wearing the al gore in ear monitors he wore on
TheyMightBeGiants_2007-0028675-0028699 the
TheyMightBeGiants_2007-0046898-0047464 we don't know that much about the history of violinists but we do know that when we entered the state of new jersey there is an
TheyMightBeGiants_2007-0061200-0061423 the guy who hit me in the
TheyMightBeGiants_2007-0086427-0086816 i think we're going to stop that
ThomMayne_2005-0001779-0002206 i'm sitting next to howard i don't know howard obviously and he's going i hope you're not next
ThomMayne_2005-0014663-0015891 to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things but basically what we do is we try to give coherence to the world we make physical things
ThomMayne_2005-0027604-0028405 through a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that experience and it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer
ThomMayne_2005-0043855-0044899 and then also was working with broad strategies in this case we only used fifteen of the sixty acres of land and the forty five acres was a park and would become the legacy
ThomMayne_2005-0055400-0056176 flattened out surfaces and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations and this was the first prototype in korea as
ThomMayne_2005-0070867-0071648 and now it turned into something much much broader as a problem and it has to do with performance this will be the first building in the united states that took
ThomMayne_2005-0091615-0092379 this is the primitive hut that's been around for so long and what we wanted to do is really kind of build this because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world
ThomMayne_2005-0103656-0104402 and other parts are much more energetic and intense and can talk about that intensity in terms of the kind of collisions of the kind of
ThomMayne_2005-0112611-0113336 dealing with michael hogan the chief justice of oregon you could not proceed without making this negotiation
ThomasBarnett_2005-0006200-0007141 my favorite bonehead concept from the nineteen nineties in the pentagon the theory of anti access area denial asymmetrical strategies why do we call it that because it's got all those
ThomasBarnett_2005-0023960-0024407 poor country runs off that ledge does that cartoon thing and then drops
ThomasBarnett_2005-0037389-0037858 we argue about it every time we use it argentina just went through it broke a lot of rules they got out on the far end we
ThomasBarnett_2005-0055212-0055992 you get then no looting no military disappearing no arms disappearing no ammo disappearing no muqtada al sadr i'm wrecking his bones no insurgency
ThomasBarnett_2005-0073131-0073972 so we were home alone for eight years and what did we do home alone we bought one military and we operated another and it's like the guy who goes to the doctor and says doctor it hurts
ThomasBarnett_2005-0091330-0091552 now we got a home game and away game
ThomasBarnett_2005-0103840-0104461 you break out that leviathan force only every so often but here's the promise you make to the american public to your own people to the world
ThomasBarnett_2005-0117273-0117457 but ultimately you're going to civilianize it
ThomasBarnett_2005-0127126-0127594 armor goes this way here's the dirty secret of the air force you can win by bombing
ThomasBarnett_2005-0137928-0138066 it's not secret
ThomasCampbell_2012-0008237-0008398 he said it's a what
ThomasCampbell_2012-0015925-0016798 and of course it was very much discussed in terms of the paintings and the sculptures and the architecture of the day
ThomasCampbell_2012-0021959-0022151 and in addition to that
ThomasCampbell_2012-0030888-0031550 we thought very hard about how to present this unknown subject to a modern audience
ThomasCampbell_2012-0039601-0040231 thick woods with hunters crashing through the undergrowth in pursuit of wild boars and deer
ThomasCampbell_2012-0046701-0047184 a few years later i was invited to be the director of the museum
ThomasCampbell_2012-0050155-0051849 in a well told narrative what the curator does the interpretation of a complex esoteric subject in a way that retains the integrity of the subject that makes it unpacks it for a general audience
ThomasCampbell_2012-0063679-0063915 it could have been a train wreck
ThomasCampbell_2012-0071436-0072329 that we can unpack the civilizations the cultures that we're seeing the current manifestation of whether it's libya
ThomasCampbell_2012-0078314-0078511 replacing the museum
ThomasCampbell_2012-0085519-0085755 from there you can walk in any direction
ThomasCampbell_2012-0091768-0092181 when the inclination is kind of to reach for your iphone your blackberry
ThomasCampbell_2012-0097338-0097630 and you've checked the jargon at the front door
ThomasDolby_2010-0020293-0020324 the
ThomasGoetz_2010P-0012881-0013709 but they have really taken this problem of behavior change and solved it it's the one great preventive health success we have in our health care system
ThomasGoetz_2010P-0028419-0028988 it was a notion that really came out of albert bandura's work who studied whether people
ThomasGoetz_2010P-0040521-0040994 we need to connect the information always with the action and then that action feeds back
ThomasGoetz_2010P-0050382-0051429 this is a pharmaceutical ad actually it's a spoof it's not a real pharmaceutical ad nobody's had the brilliant idea of calling their drug havidol quite yet
ThomasGoetz_2010P-0062416-0063194 so i love this i love that drug facts box and so i was thinking about what's an opportunity that i could have to help people understand
ThomasGoetz_2010P-0076477-0077308 then we went to crp test in this case it's a sin of omission they have this huge amount of space and they don't use it for anything so we do
ThomasGoetz_2010P-0090197-0090965 so i want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask because i don't actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports
ThomasHeatherwick_2011-0009282-0009591 this is a shop for a bag company
ThomasHeatherwick_2011-0013372-0014137 and just very quickly something we've been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of london to design a new bus
ThomasHeatherwick_2011-0020650-0021571 i was going to show four main projects and this is a project for a bridge and so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open
ThomasHeatherwick_2011-0039140-0040261 so it felt this has a social dimension it has a symbolic importance and we should be proud of where our power is coming from rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of
ThomasHeatherwick_2011-0060927-0062785 we didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content so we were trying to think how could we make a whole thing emanate by the way we had half the budget of the other western nations so that was also in the mix with the site the size of a football pitch and so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue
ThomasHeatherwick_2011-0081470-0081692 i'm sorry about my stupid voice there
ThomasInsel_2013X-0005759-0006620 heart disease used to be the biggest killer particularly for men in their forty s today we've seen a sixty three percent reduction in mortality from heart disease
ThomasInsel_2013X-0017913-0019680 now when we talk about suicide there is also a medical contribution here because ninety percent of suicides are related to a mental illness depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia anorexia borderline personality there's a long list of disorders that contribute
ThomasInsel_2013X-0030935-0032489 now i started by telling you that there were some good news stories this is obviously not one of them this is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult and in a sense this is a kind of confession for me my job is to actually make sure that we make progress
ThomasInsel_2013X-0043388-0043634 but this is
ThomasInsel_2013X-0059826-0060412 these are scans from judy rapoport and her colleagues at the national institute of mental health
ThomasInsel_2013X-0072736-0073112 that's not early detection that's not early intervention
ThomasSuarez_2011X-0014484-0015437 i persuaded my parents to pay the ninety nine dollar fee to be able to put my apps on the app store they agreed and now i have apps on the app store
ThomasThwaites_2010S-0010517-0011496 there are four hundred different bits made out of a hundred plus different materials i didn't have the rest of my life to do this project
ThomasThwaites_2010S-0024895-0025500 so i ended up going to the history of science library and looking at this book this is the first textbook on metallurgy
ThomasThwaites_2010S-0035807-0036507 next thing i was off to scotland to get mica and mica is a mineral
ThomasThwaites_2010S-0059067-0059159 there's a picture of
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I-0012489-0013782 and then we added several what we call vision centers as a hub and spoke model and then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I-0022088-0022669 a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence doctor whatever you
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I-0030505-0030725 he kept talking about mcdonalds and hamburgers and
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I-0045775-0046868 kind of logistics and support many people like this would probably never get services and certainly not when they most need it they receive surgery the following day
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I-0064135-0064841 a surgeon operating and then you see on the other side another patient is getting ready so as they finish
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I-0076817-0077703 i think in absolute terms last year we earned about twenty odd million dollars spent about thirteen million with over a forty percent
ThulasirajRavilla_2009I-0099496-0100592 now how do you make people own the problem want to do something about it there are a bit harder issues and i'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these so i want to end my talk
TierneyThys_2003-0010158-0011023 and a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans that is unless you eat jellyfish
TierneyThys_2003-0022250-0022666 really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say a tuna
TierneyThys_2003-0033693-0034633 three hundred million eggs can carry three hundred million eggs in her ovaries imagine and they get to be over ten feet long imagine what a ten foot one
TierneyThys_2003-0045064-0045889 and unfortunately they make up a large portion of the california by catch up to twenty six percent of the drift net and in the mediterranean in
TierneyThys_2003-0061011-0062047 into the ultimate frisbee mola style and then tosses them back and forth and i'm not exaggerating it is just and sometimes they don't eat them it's just spiteful and you know
TierneyThys_2003-0072327-0073313 and everything from the kidney to the testes to the back bone to the fin muscle to i think that as pretty much the whole fish is
TierneyThys_2003-0086477-0087879 variety of food's in that layer so rather than just being some sunbathing slacker they're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through temperature
TimBernersLee_2009-0003042-0003547 now twenty years on at ted i want to ask your help in a new
TimBernersLee_2009-0013035-0013719 virtual documentation system in the sky say on the internet then life would be so much easier
TimBernersLee_2009-0029444-0030520 the economics in the developing world he put up a slide a little bit like this it had underground all the data ok data is brown and boxy and boring and that's how we think of it
TimBernersLee_2009-0044897-0046069 the city where they were born i can look up the region it's in and the town it's in and the population of it and so on so i can browse this stuff so that's it really that is linked data
TimBernersLee_2009-0050739-0051523 he noticed that wikipedia you know wikipedia the online encyclopedia with lots and lots of interesting documents in it well in those documents
TimBernersLee_2009-0059086-0060098 speech that he american government data would be available on the internet in accessible formats and i hope that they will put it up as linked data
TimBernersLee_2009-0074686-0075829 data and now they can ask the sort of question that you probably wouldn't ask i wouldn't ask they would what proteins are involved in signal transduction and also related to pyramidal neurons well you take that mouthful and you put it into
TimBernersLee_2009-0089699-0090504 doing their bit to produce a little bit and it all connecting that's how linked data works you do your bit
TimBernersLee_2010U-0009212-0009974 this data effect things well actually let's get back to two thousand and eight look at zanesville ohio here is a map a lawyer made he put on it the water
TimBernersLee_2010U-0026514-0027485 this is january in time lapse of people editing that's the earthquake after the earthquake immediately people all over the world mappers who wanted to help and could
TimBrown_2008P-0013337-0013665 and he would point this out as evidence
TimBrown_2008P-0027305-0028468 it takes more than decor but i think we a ve all seen that you know creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace that remind people to be playful
TimBrown_2008P-0042437-0042778 right this is pretty good this is pretty good okay all right
TimBrown_2008P-0055539-0056491 so we a ve all seen it haven a t we we a ve all told stories about how on christmas morning you know our kids end up playing with the boxes far more than they play with the toys that are inside
TimBrown_2008P-0075243-0076681 they were you know engineers physicists mathematicians architects furniture designers even artists and he asked them to come along one evening and bring a problem with them that they were working on
TimBrown_2008P-0091354-0093271 they were exploring following what was interesting to them and they went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of world war ii and the korean war i think and from this experiment they moved on to chairs and through constant experimentation with materials developed a wide range of iconic solutions that we know today and eventually resulting in of course the legendary lounge chair
TimBrown_2008P-0107899-0108867 something into the real world and having your thinking advanced as a result at ideo there a s a kind of a back to preschool feel sometimes about the environment
TimBrown_2008P-0128675-0129854 then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized we a ve gone through lots of experiences in life and they provide a strong intuition as to whether an interaction is going to work
TimBrown_2008P-0144236-0144955 people who do this at ideo anyway not just because they lead to insights about the experience but also because of their willingness
TimBrown_2008P-0163106-0164085 so to kind of sum it up we need trust to play and we need trust to be creative so there a s a connection
TimBrown_2009G-0009825-0011102 so when we talk about design today and particularly when we read about it in the popular press we're often talking about products like these amusing yes desirable maybe important not so very
TimBrown_2009G-0018635-0019462 long viaducts across river valleys this is actually the viaduct across the thames at maidenhead and long tunnels such as the one at box
TimBrown_2009G-0024754-0025683 opposing ideas and opposing constraints to create new solutions in the case of design that means balancing desirability
TimBrown_2009G-0037342-0038179 they wanted to understand what the aspirations and motivations were of these school children to understand how they might play a role in screening
TimBrown_2009G-0050045-0051171 partly they did this by instead of building a fancy new factory they used the basement of one of their hospitals and instead of installing the large scale machines
TimBrown_2009G-0066936-0067068 and
TimBrown_2009G-0081159-0082544 but before we go through that process of divergence there is actually quite an important first step and that is what is the question that we're trying to answer what's the design brief now brunel may have asked a question like this how do i take a train from london to new york
TimBrown_2009G-0091780-0092589 by focusing on the needs of humans and by using prototypes to move ideas along quickly by
TimFerriss_2008P-0011551-0012391 when i realized that i was not the incredible hulk but there is a happy ending to this story at age thirty one that's my age now
TimFerriss_2008P-0024607-0025286 or not good at it the first is forget about kicking very counterintuitive so it turns out that propulsion
TimFerriss_2008P-0041439-0041987 the response a sad state of affairs then i transferred to a different school
TimFerriss_2008P-0053315-0054379 this is the joyo kanji this is a tablet rather or a poster of the one thousand nine hundred and forty five common use characters as determined by the ministry of education in one
TimFerriss_2008P-0066263-0067008 ten women two guys usually a good ratio the instructor says you are participating immediately death sweat
TimFerriss_2008P-0079065-0080123 long steps so a lot of milongueros the tango dancers will use very short steps i found that longer steps were much more elegant so you can have
TimHarford_2011G-0001612-0001770 the second world war
TimHarford_2011G-0018253-0019290 breaks down and weeps because he's convinced that the situation is hopeless but a young german doctor
TimHarford_2011G-0033986-0034364 so it'll show you gdp per capita population
TimHarford_2011G-0048722-0049114 and we don't we never do
TimHarford_2011G-0058049-0058321 how do you design that nozzle
TimHarford_2011G-0069293-0070855 that is a huge failure rate it's far higher than the failure rate of say americans ten percent of americans don't disappear every year which leads us to conclude american businesses fail faster than americans and therefore american businesses are evolving faster than americans
TimHarford_2011G-0084930-0086073 the question of where is it that patients should recover from heart attacks should they recover in a specialized cardiac unit in hospital or should they recover at home
TimHarford_2011G-0100294-0101622 it turned out to be absolutely instrumental many decades later in proving fermat's last theorem in fact it turns out it's equivalent to proving fermat's last theorem you prove one you prove the other
TimJackson_2010G-0008557-0009926 it's a dilemma a dilemma of growth we can't live with it we can't live without it trash the system or crash the planet it's a tough choice it isn't much of a choice and our best avenue of escape from this actually is a
TimJackson_2010G-0030026-0030889 status driven conspicuous consumption thrives from the language of novelty and here all of a sudden
TimJackson_2010G-0048411-0049022 are as people here's another one completely different one why is it
TimJackson_2010G-0060213-0061366 what is the objective what is the objective of the consumer mary douglas asked in an essay on poverty written thirty five years ago it is she said
TimJackson_2010G-0074278-0075357 rembrandt's fragile altruist within what does all this mean for economics what would economies look like if we took that vision
TimJackson_2010G-0082822-0083710 gave revenues to ecosia and ecosia is giving eighty percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project it's taking profits from one place
TimJackson_2010G-0090320-0091630 and of course this task has material dimensions it would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing if they didn't have food clothing and shelter but it's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this it has social and psychological aims
TimJackson_2010G-0103436-0104109 says i am because we are prosperity is a shared endeavor
TimJackson_2010G-0114751-0115346 is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together or is it going to be more just civil society and companies
TimLeberecht_2012G-0007434-0008162 they can listen and join the conversation in fact they have more control over the loss of control than ever before
TimLeberecht_2012G-0015635-0015960 the free publicity the added value all helped drive sales
TimLeberecht_2012G-0023017-0023596 giving people less control might be a wonderful way to counter the abundance of choice
TimLeberecht_2012G-0033139-0033394 staying true to their true selves
TimothyBartik_2012X-0004102-0005060 but what i want to talk about is what preschool does for state economies and for promoting state economic development
TimothyBartik_2012X-0010097-0010346 they don't generally think first about
TimothyBartik_2012X-0016598-0018252 but in a different way it's a somewhat more indirect way these programs can promote more and better jobs by you build it you invest in high quality preschool it develops the skills of your local workforce if enough of them stick around
TimothyBartik_2012X-0031726-0032630 get more skills that actually increases the prosperity of everyone including people whose skills don't change
TimothyBartik_2012X-0044722-0046074 so if someone gets a college degree their lifetime earnings go up by a huge amount over seven hundred thousand dollars there's an effect on everyone else in the metro area of driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area
TimothyBartik_2012X-0057314-0058401 so you know maybe ohio's thinking about investing in more preschool education for children in columbus ohio
TimothyBartik_2012X-0073782-0074924 and of course as i mentioned this cost has corresponding benefits i mentioned there's a multiplier of about three two point seven eight for the state economy in terms of over eighty billion in extra earnings
TimothyBartik_2012X-0085898-0086207 and so what i want to leave you with
TimothyPrestero_2012X-0011401-0012193 so this seemed like a problem that we could do something about keeping a baby warm for a week that's not rocket science
TimothyPrestero_2012X-0023491-0024811 michael free at path says you have to figure out who will choose use and pay the dues for a product like this and i have to ask the question vc's always ask sir what is your business and who is your customer who is our customer
TimothyPrestero_2012X-0035444-0036578 bright blue light on as much of the skin as you can cover how is this a hard problem so i went to mit okay we'll figure that out
TimothyPrestero_2012X-0052346-0054002 that's the design for manufacture question when we think about actual use you'll notice that firefly has a single bassinet it only fits a single baby and the idea here is it's obvious how you ought to use this device if you try to put more than one kid in you're stacking them on top of each other laughter so
TodMachover_2008-0002345-0002571 if you don't just listen to it but you make it yourself
TodMachover_2008-0014960-0016097 the model works but it's only the tip of the iceberg because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want to make music in something like guitar hero and music is very fun but it's also transformative
TodMachover_2008-0027557-0028727 and with that you can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes movement to people with parkinson's disease it's very powerful for depression schizophrenia many many things
TodMachover_2008-0048107-0049420 and the opera is about what we can share what we can pass on to others to the people we love and what we can't every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument like this chandelier it takes up the whole stage it looks like a chandelier but it's actually a
TodMachover_2008-0062084-0062875 but we're also making this available both online and in public spaces as a way of each of us to use music and images of our lives
TodMachover_2008-0078104-0079272 and i'll let adam tell you so adam is a ph d student at mit an expert in music technology and medicine and adam and dan have become close collaborators what adam's been working on for this last period
TodMachover_2008-0087015-0087916 you know what's his metaphor for performance what types of things does he find important to control and convey in a piece of music so all the parameter fitting and really
TodMachover_2008-0093265-0094240 so dan is going to play a piece of his called my eagle song in fact this is the score of dan's piece completely composed by dan in hyperscore so he can use his infrared
ToddHumphreys_2012X-0002182-0002512 that had a profound effect on the way our society operates
ToddHumphreys_2012X-0012031-0012327 is pathetic compared to what we could be getting
ToddHumphreys_2012X-0020254-0020618 the holy grail of course is the gps dot
ToddHumphreys_2012X-0029339-0030649 i couldn't find my shoes one recent morning and as usual had to ask my wife if she had seen them but i shouldn't have to bother my wife with that kind of triviality i should be able to ask my house where my shoes
ToddHumphreys_2012X-0038583-0038920 well then you'd better go to the police i said
ToddHumphreys_2012X-0047116-0047452 it's an open source gps jammer
ToddHumphreys_2012X-0056471-0057087 and now it's just you and the fog and whatever you can pull off the radar system if you remember how to work it
ToddHumphreys_2012X-0063836-0065441 so let me show you how this works in any gps receiver there's a peak inside that corresponds to the authentic signals these three red dots represent the tracking points that try to keep themselves centered on that peak but if you send in a fake gps signal
ToddHumphreys_2012X-0072497-0072996 i remember vividly the week it all came together we built it at my home
ToddHumphreys_2012X-0081132-0082542 i saw the gps derived timing of the new york stock exchange being manipulated by hackers you can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc you could cause if you knew what you were doing with a gps spoofer
ToddHumphreys_2012X-0090612-0091306 you'll never lose track of your things again the gps dot will fundamentally reorder your life
ToddKuiken_2011G-0015413-0016617 they work pretty well for people who have just lost their hand because your hand muscles are still there you squeeze your hand these muscles contract you open it these muscles contract so it's intuitive and it works pretty well
ToddKuiken_2011G-0031441-0032158 so our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation imagine with somebody who's lost their whole arm we still have
ToddKuiken_2011G-0045485-0047225 on the right side two months after we fit him with his targeted reinnervation prosthesis which by the way is the same physical arm just programmed a little different you can see that he's much faster and much smoother as he moves these little blocks and we're only able to use three of the signals at this time
ToddKuiken_2011G-0062476-0062771 to get it to change modes when i did
ToddKuiken_2011G-0072825-0073259 and we wanted to get more you can move each finger you can move your thumb
ToddKuiken_2011G-0088926-0090128 so amanda you can see has really good control it's all the pattern recognition and it now has a hand that can do different grasps what we do is have the patient go all the way open and think
TomChatfield_2010G-0002999-0004206 in awe at their power to motivate to compel us to transfix us like really nothing else we've ever invented has quite done before and i think
TomChatfield_2010G-0016163-0017368 and by answering that question i think we can take something extremely powerful away and i think the most interesting way to think about how all this is going on is in terms of rewards
TomChatfield_2010G-0031098-0032239 you can think about this if you like as a problem about boxes i've got to keep opening boxes i don't know what's inside them until i open them and i go around opening box after box until i've got fifteen
TomChatfield_2010G-0048740-0049960 we evolved to be satisfied by the world in particular ways over tens and hundreds of thousands of years we evolved to find certain things stimulating and as very intelligent civilized beings we're enormously stimulated by problem solving and
TomChatfield_2010G-0066488-0067379 and if you think about using this in testing in just introducing control elements of randomness in all forms of testing and training you can transform
TomChatfield_2010G-0083039-0084217 and i just want to end by suggesting a few ways in which these principle could fan out into the world i'll start with business i mean we're beginning to see some of the big problems around something like business
TomHoney_2005-0002170-0003032 i've been struggling and grappling with questions about the nature of god who is god
TomHoney_2005-0017179-0018014 then on december twenty sixth last year just two months ago that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami
TomHoney_2005-0029760-0030652 this is true and yet here we are my church in oxford semi detached from events
TomHoney_2005-0040348-0040907 the slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps have caused people to ask
TomHoney_2005-0052900-0053475 does god have a plan for each of us is god in control does god order each moment
TomHoney_2005-0067602-0068712 and that would be the point at which i would hand in my membership such a god would be morally inferior to the highest ideals of humanity
TomHoney_2005-0081598-0082266 is god intimately involved in our suffering so that he feels it in his own being
TomHoney_2005-0097749-0098853 to have faith in this god would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements
TomHoney_2005-0110333-0111149 it needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting a contemplative attitude
TomHoney_2005-0116205-0116274 thank you
TomRielly_2006-0008383-0009185 just to review this is my tedtalk we're going to do some jokes some gags
TomRielly_2006-0021734-0022023 all right now i want to do a little bit of
TomRielly_2006-0035367-0035639 right now
TomRielly_2006-0048090-0048430 ok ok ok ok excellent
TomRielly_2006-0062677-0062907 but the thing that i'm really really excited about
TomRielly_2006-0077333-0077458 so
TomRielly_2006-0094199-0095153 now i don't know about you but sometimes i have these images in my head of separated at birth i don't know about you but when i see aubrey de grey i immediately go to gandalf the
TomRielly_2006-0113142-0113409 a few years later there's no snow left at all
TomShannon_2003-0002238-0002591 an object that has different degrees of freedom so it
TomShannon_2003-0007343-0008244 roll and the sphere has that balance property that is always sort of stays still and looks the same from every direction but
TomShannon_2003-0020329-0020745 it reduces proportionately each ball and the spaces between them
TomShannon_2003-0033266-0034076 this is another species of work that i do these are these arrays these spheres are all suspended but they have magnets horizontally in them
TomShannon_2003-0046563-0046911 of and i had a lot of
TomShannon_2003-0062578-0063386 aware that could communicate it's completely silent and nonpolluting it has electric motors with a novel propulsion system
TomShannon_2009S-0005619-0006452 what would the taper be to the earth and so i went about it and made that sculpture turning it out of solid bronze and
TomShannon_2009S-0016925-0017651 it allows me to manifest these invisible forces that are holding the magnets up my
TomShannon_2009S-0027924-0028020 so here are the
TomShannon_2009S-0033649-0033880 up to another level where
TomShannon_2009S-0038410-0038937 so many forces there you've got gravity you've got the centrifugal force you've got the fluid dynamics
TomShannon_2009S-0052498-0053467 spaced lines which get closer and closer together which describes how gravity works there's something very appealing about the exactitude of science
TomShannon_2009S-0063578-0064317 the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life is that relevant to your work ts as it turns out
TomShannon_2009S-0074758-0075749 we're kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency of the universe and to interface with it
TomThum_2013X-0035722-0036025 germany
TomWujec_2009G-0004282-0004860 a very simple a very common an everyday question and that question is this
TomWujec_2009G-0016823-0017489 and the altitude corresponds to the plate system now the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection
TomWujec_2009G-0030532-0032026 of the device deneb is there i can tell step four is i then move the rete move the sky so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back okay so when that happens
TomWujec_2009G-0044983-0045999 and i think what is common to all astrolabes is that they are beautiful works of art there is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable
TomWujec_2009GU-0005112-0005547 time is it if you glance at your iphone it's so simple to tell the time but
TomWujec_2009GU-0015580-0016418 so the north star corresponds to the center of the device the ecliptic which is the path of the sun moon and planets correspond to an offset circle
TomWujec_2009GU-0026304-0027300 on both sides of the street maybe a school thrown in and some you know a church they are just incredibly expensive but let me show you how to work this device so let's go to step one
TomWujec_2009GU-0041013-0041889 so that's just one use incredible there is probably three hundred and fifty four hundred uses in fact there is a text and that has over a thousand uses
TomWujec_2009U-0003919-0004902 and the consensus was it really worked these sketches brought to life the key ideas the portraits the magic moments that we all experienced last year
TomWujec_2009U-0021012-0022081 now we've augmented this and spatialized this information many of you may remember the magic wall that we built in conjunction with perceptive pixel where we quite literally create an infinite wall
TomWujec_2009U-0034764-0036065 here what we can do is look at sustainability quite literally so a team can actually look at all the key components that heat the structure and make choices and then see the end result that is visualized on this screen
TonyPorter_2010W-0003926-0004717 and you should just follow and do what we say that men are superior women are inferior that men are strong women
TonyPorter_2010W-0008961-0009858 really need to begin to challenge look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing redefining what we come to know
TonyPorter_2010W-0024088-0024268 my father and i stayed in
TonyPorter_2010W-0029773-0030133 i can remember speaking to a twelve year old boy a football player
TonyPorter_2010W-0034402-0035002 in tenement buildings in the inner city at this time we're living in the bronx and in the building next to where i lived there was a
TonyPorter_2010W-0043301-0044067 as men you only tell your dearest closest friend sworn to secrecy for life the first time you had sex for everybody else we go around like we've been having sex
TonyPorter_2010W-0052972-0053125 and i say to them it was good
TonyPorter_2010W-0061041-0061203 the world i envision for her
TonyRobbins_2006-0013682-0014904 so i've had an obsession basically for thirty years and that obsession has been what makes the difference in the quality of peoples lives what makes the difference in their performance because that's what i got hired to do i've got to produce the result now that's what i've done for thirty years
TonyRobbins_2006-0037100-0037996 the defining factor is never resources it's resourcefulness and what i mean specifically rather than just some phrase is if you have emotion human emotion
TonyRobbins_2006-0050794-0051955 i know the google geniuses i saw here i mean i understand that their decision was to sell their technology at first what if they made that decision versus to build their own culture how would the world be different how would their lives be different their impact
TonyRobbins_2006-0068006-0068462 a second human need which is uncertainty we need variety we need
TonyRobbins_2006-0095109-0096180 so finally and i'm about out of time the target that shapes you here's what's different about people we have the same needs but are you a certainty freak is that what you value most or uncertainty
TonyRobbins_2006-0111750-0112773 her friend her new boyfriend wanted to marry her and she said no he said if you leave and go to that hawaii thing it's over with us she said it's over when i finished that night she called him and left a message true story at the top of the world trade
TorstenReil_2003-0012429-0013587 the only way to get around that is to actually simulate the human body and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body and maybe if i could have you for a quick demonstration to show what the difference is
TorstenReil_2003-0033507-0033814 but now after generation twenty it actually walks in a straight line without
TorstenReil_2003-0048022-0049377 motor skills in the upper body nothing in the legs yet in this particular one but what it will do i'm going to push it again it will realize autonomously that it's being pushed it's going to stick out its hands it's going to turn around into the fall and try and catch the fall
TorstenReil_2003-0056396-0057266 this is all slow motion by the way so we can see what's going on now the angle will have changed a tiny bit so you can see that the reaction is different
TorstenReil_2003-0065295-0066068 going to release in a couple of weeks so here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked that's what people want that's
TorstenReil_2003-0087747-0088758 now this could do with a bit more work it's still very early stages and we pretty much just did this for a laugh just to see what we'd get out of it but what we found over the past few months is that this approach
TorstenReil_2003-0101753-0102652 we do have one unintentional dancer actually the last thing i wanted to show you this was an ai contour that was produced and evolved half evolved i should say
TracyChevalier_2012S-0015500-0016634 why a story well i think that we are wired our dna tells us to tell stories we tell stories all the time about everything and i think we do it
TracyChevalier_2012S-0029986-0030263 so here's how i came up with the story
TracyChevalier_2012S-0041737-0043493 we happen to know there's a list of catharina the wife's clothes amongst them a yellow coat with white fur a yellow and black bodice and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings different women in the paintings vermeer's paintings
TracyChevalier_2012S-0058145-0059676 again and again back to the painting looking for the answer looking for the story to fill in that gap and we may make a story and it satisfies us momentarily but not really and we come back again and again
TracyChevalier_2012S-0071056-0071243 here's the story
TracyChevalier_2012S-0081358-0082137 we will still see each other i insisted we can still hunt and play cards and attend court nothing need change
TristramStuart_2012S-0008867-0009658 one morning when i was feeding my pigs i noticed a particularly tasty looking sun dried tomato loaf that used to crop up from time to time
TristramStuart_2012S-0021053-0021674 represents unnecessary surplus and is likely to reflect levels of waste in each country
TristramStuart_2012S-0033782-0034189 and when we chop down forests as we are every day to grow more and more food
TristramStuart_2012S-0043948-0045291 that is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources especially when you think of the billion hungry people that exist already in the world having gone through the data i then needed to demonstrate where that food ends up
TristramStuart_2012S-0058090-0058479 potatoes that are cosmetically imperfect all going for pigs
TristramStuart_2012S-0072179-0073329 some food waste as i said at the beginning will inevitably arise so the question is what is the best thing to do with it i answered that question when i was fifteen in fact humans answered that question six thousand years ago
TylerDeWitt_2012X-0002840-0003807 but i'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything
TylerDeWitt_2012X-0010750-0010948 i
TylerDeWitt_2012X-0017180-0018027 and then things get really horrible as his skin rips apart and he sees a virus coming out from his insides
TylerDeWitt_2012X-0029114-0030536 here this cloaked secret agent virus is slipping his dna into the bacterial cell but here's the kicker it doesn't do anything harmful not at first instead
TylerDeWitt_2012X-0040036-0040290 why did they hate it so much
TylerDeWitt_2012X-0052459-0053835 for example i told you that viruses have dna well a very tiny fraction of them don't they have something called rna instead so a professional science writer would circle that and say that has to go we have to change it to something much more technical
TylerDeWitt_2012X-0071093-0072314 but if a young learner can't understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this that will ruin their chances of success
TyroneHayes_2010W-0002844-0004596 the most commonly used preservative in baby care products mimics estrogen when it gets into the human body now it's very easy actually to get a chemical compound from products into the human body through the skin and these preservatives had been found in breast cancer tumors
TyroneHayes_2010W-0022205-0024103 even for amphibians in some cases another species like the north american leopard frog showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes and you can see these large yolked up eggs bursting through the surface of this male's testes now my wife tells me and i'm sure penelope can as well that there's nothing more painful than childbirth which
TyroneHayes_2010W-0037984-0038737 which has been in the news recently it's a plasticizer it's a compound that's found in polycarbonate plastic
TyroneHayes_2010W-0046377-0047140 and our children the baby bottle scenario proves that we can prevent unnecessary exposure however
TyroneHayes_2010W-0053540-0054194 the evidence of that is that studies in rats again with atrazine show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion
TyroneHayes_2010W-0080156-0080338 tyrone talks about
TyroneHayes_2010W-0095614-0096131 which goes into these buckets is the sole source of drinking cooking and bathing water for this village
UeliGegenschatz_2009-0008611-0009550 from freeflying i went on to skysurfing skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet you can imagine with this big
UeliGegenschatz_2009-0022909-0023832 so with some friends we started to do different tricks like for example this jump here i jumped from a paraglider or here everybody
UeliGegenschatz_2009-0062224-0063279 not possible to land a wingsuit yet jc yet but people are trying are you among those you're not going to commit are you among those trying to do it ue it's a dream it's a dream yeah we're still working on it
UrsusWehrli_2006-0005512-0006040 but don't worry i don't have trouble with english as such i mean it's not my problem it's your language
UrsusWehrli_2006-0016748-0017887 world of modern art is particularly topsy turvy and i can show you a very good example it's actually a simple one but it's a good one to start with it's a picture by paul klee
UrsusWehrli_2006-0023349-0023526 that's great so i mean
UrsusWehrli_2006-0029326-0030564 here is a very good example to see this is a picture by joan miro and yeah we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background
UrsusWehrli_2006-0043928-0044885 and i mean in the original it's completely unclear to see what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict
UrsusWehrli_2006-0053060-0053909 one can obviously also make combinations for example with the keith haring circles and kandinsky's dots you can add them to all the squares of paul klee
UrsusWehrli_2006-0063053-0063789 like books clothes toothbrush et cetera and it was great by the time i returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place
UrsusWehrli_2006-0072974-0073947 now i've been able to tidy up pictures that i've wanted to tidy up for a long time here is a very good example take jackson pollock for example it's
UrsusWehrli_2006-0085899-0086751 yeah maybe you're asking yourselves where old brugel's people went of course they're not gone they're all here
VanJones_2010X-0003752-0004989 and both in the production of plastic the use of plastic and the disposal of plastic the people who have bull's eye on their foreheads are poor people people got very upset
VanJones_2010X-0015399-0016252 a different product well the problem with being poor is you don't have those choices you often have to buy the cheapest products the cheapest products are often the most dangerous
VanJones_2010X-0034007-0035253 so we all are being hit we all are being impacted it's just the poor people get hit first and worst but the dirty production the burning of toxins the lack of environmental standards in asia is actually creating so much dirty
VanJones_2010X-0053047-0054051 of biomimicry respecting the wisdom of all species combined with the idea of democracy and social justice respecting the wisdom and the worth of all people
VanJones_2010X-0069702-0070692 and so we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement when we take on topics like this it gives us that extra call
VickiArroyo_2012G-0012544-0013113 like it or not ready or not this is our future
VickiArroyo_2012G-0029736-0030074 in russia in two thousand and ten
VickiArroyo_2012G-0044354-0045601 planes require more runway for takeoff because the heated less dense air provides for less lift san francisco is also spending forty million dollars to rethink and redesign its water and sewage treatment
VijayKumar_2012-0002283-0003522 beach balls no agile aerial robots like this one i'd like to tell you a little bit about the challenges in building these and some of the terrific opportunities for applying this technology
VijayKumar_2012-0010282-0011226 so let me give you just a very quick tutorial on how these robots work so it has four rotors if you spin these rotors at the same speed the robot hovers
VijayKumar_2012-0014787-0014972 then the robot pitches forward
VijayKumar_2012-0020071-0020311 scales as a fifth power of r
VijayKumar_2012-0027339-0028460 applications like construction so here are robots carrying beams columns and assembling cube like structures i'll tell you a little bit more about this
VijayKumar_2012-0034904-0035222 what we call a minimum snap trajectory
VijayKumar_2012-0044995-0046017 learns or is pre programmed so here you see the robot combining a motion that builds up momentum and then changes its orientation and then recovers
VijayKumar_2012-0057496-0059013 fast enough in order for the robots to accomplish the task plus the robots have to base their actions only on local information what they sense from their neighbors and then finally we insist that the robots be agnostic to who their neighbors are
VijayKumar_2012-0068615-0068981 cubic structures from truss like elements
VijayKumar_2012-0079026-0079455 so this robot is actually being commanded remotely by frank
VikMuniz_2003-0002001-0002802 i can in fifteen minutes i think i can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of creation which i call creativity
VikMuniz_2003-0015225-0016001 another point why i'm here is that the day i went to pick up the plexiglass trophy i rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life
VikMuniz_2003-0028779-0028945 this is the pre columbian coffeemaker
VikMuniz_2003-0038565-0039746 and he worked this with three point perspective which was brand new technology at the time and it's totally overkill and your eye doesn't know which level to read and you become trapped into this kind of
VikMuniz_2003-0049452-0050356 i had met a group of children in the caribbean island of saint kitts and i did work and play with them i got some photographs from them
VikMuniz_2003-0065125-0066401 they end up being very large pictures and i photographed with a very large camera an eight by ten camera so you can see the surface of every single swatch like in this picture of chuck close and you have to walk very far to be able to see it
VikMuniz_2003-0075589-0076631 this is another thing that i did you know working everybody loves to watch somebody draw but not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in
VikMuniz_2003-0087509-0088398 a measure of their own belief how much you want to be fooled that's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that well i think that that's it my time is
VikramPatel_2012G-0013149-0013913 when you put all the mental illnesses together they account for roughly fifteen percent of the total global burden of disease
VikramPatel_2012G-0019023-0019838 i see some nodding heads there but beyond the staggering numbers
VikramPatel_2012G-0027329-0028580 it's this injustice that has really driven my mission to try to do a little bit to transform the lives of people affected by mental illness and a particularly critical action that i focused on is to bridge the gulf
VikramPatel_2012G-0040019-0041671 about some other model of care it was then that i came across these books and in these books i discovered the idea of task shifting in global health the idea is actually quite simple the idea is when you're short of specialized health care professionals
VikramPatel_2012G-0057429-0058314 and importantly we need to reallocate the few specialists who are available to perform roles such as capacity building and supervision
VikramPatel_2012G-0069322-0071293 it is for this reason that some years ago the movement for global mental health was founded as a sort of a virtual platform upon which professionals like myself and people affected by mental illness could stand together shoulder to shoulder and advocate for the rights of people with mental illness to receive the care that we know can transform their lives
VilayanurRamachandran_2007-0016434-0017489 ok now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus but there's another rare syndrome so rare in fact that very few physicians have heard about it not even neurologists this is called the
VilayanurRamachandran_2007-0032442-0033581 now when that area's damaged you lose the ability to see faces right but from that area the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system the emotional core of the brain
VilayanurRamachandran_2007-0046932-0047178 what happens what happens if you show
VilayanurRamachandran_2007-0059591-0060396 phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month and in fact one student asked me the other day do they get phantom pms
VilayanurRamachandran_2007-0079161-0079942 he had his arm amputated ten years ago he had a brachial avulsion so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed lying in a sling for a year
VilayanurRamachandran_2007-0092888-0093653 so i said look derek well first of all the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain i said look derek take it home and practice with it
VilayanurRamachandran_2007-0105190-0105903 and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors this has also gone through clinical trials helping lots and lots of patients
VilayanurRamachandran_2007-0119520-0120308 so every brain region is wired to every other region and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain
VilayanurRamachandran_2007-0135975-0136759 what all that glitters is not gold what does that mean the patient says well if it's metallic and shiny it doesn't mean it's gold you have to measure its specific gravity
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I-0012884-0013865 also fire when i'm looking at somebody else performing the same action so here is a neuron that fires when i reach and grab something but it also fires when i watch joe reaching and grabbing something
VilayanurRamachandran_2009I-0029294-0030420 so it's empathizing the other person being touched so most of them will fire when i'm touched in different locations different neurons for different locations but a subset of them will fire even when i watch somebody else being touched in the same location
VinayVenkatraman_2012S-0002745-0003219 that's what we're after and we do this because we actually believe
VinayVenkatraman_2012S-0007473-0009198 he has this little ten square meter store where so much is being done it's incredible because i couldn't believe my eyes when i once just happened to bump into him basically what he does is he has all these services for micro payments and booking tickets and all kinds of basic things that you would
VinayVenkatraman_2012S-0015293-0015541 this morning and you can go pick it up after lunch
VinayVenkatraman_2012S-0024897-0025507 the main thing is a fix it locally culture which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn't have
VinayVenkatraman_2012S-0035207-0035485 that can be constructed locally and serviced locally
VinayVenkatraman_2012S-0047001-0047682 and the other key thing that we did was make this box run off a usb key because we realized that even though there was gprs and all that
VinayVenkatraman_2012S-0057442-0058445 so we said what can we do with the asha worker that'll allow this asha worker to become an interesting filter but not just a filter a really well thought through referral system
VinayVenkatraman_2012S-0063082-0064071 that would be amazing so what we did was that we converted this device into a medical device i want to demo this actually because it's a very simple process
VirginiaPostrel_2004-0002790-0003802 like marlene dietrich and it comes in a male form too very glamorous not only can he shoot drive you know he drinks wine there actually is a little wine in there
VirginiaPostrel_2004-0024801-0025761 and it involves a great deal of technique it's not glamour is not something you don't wake up in the morning glamorous i don't care who you are even nicole kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous
VirginiaPostrel_2004-0039282-0039343 also not
VirginiaPostrel_2004-0048589-0049447 from the everyday the same thing arches are very glamorous arches with stained glass even more glamorous staircases that curve away from
VirginiaPostrel_2004-0064127-0065097 have to have mystery and you have to have grace and there she is grace this is the most glamorous picture i think ever and part of the thing is that in rear window
VirginiaPostrel_2004-0082334-0083245 this is from soviet union attractive i mean look how happy the people are and good looking too you know we're marching toward utopia
VusiMahlaselaSONGOFMAMA_2007G-0007514-0008051 and i started asking questions and that a s when my political education you know started
VusiMahlaselaSONGOFMAMA_2007G-0033545-0034027 song like the blues man or troubadour a a and
VusiMahlasela_SongofMama_2007G-0007798-0008941 and i started asking questions and that s when my political education started and i joined later on the youth organization under the african national congress
WadahKhanfar_2011-0013684-0015312 yes they got rid of saddam hussein but when they saw their land occupied by foreign forces they felt very sad they felt that their dignity had suffered and this is why they revolted this is why they did not accept
WadahKhanfar_2011-0022598-0022808 and a global understanding
WadahKhanfar_2011-0041792-0042241 we put it in every sitting room in the arab world and internationally globally
WadahKhanfar_2011-0078318-0079354 in order to embrace change and in order to celebrate with the people of that region a great future and hope and tolerance
WadeDavis_2008-0002561-0003781 and infused with consciousness began a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habitable world for a time we shared the stage with our distant cousins neanderthal who clearly had some spark of awareness but whether it was the
WadeDavis_2008-0016884-0018135 but the corollary of that is that if we all are brothers and sisters and share the same genetic material all human populations share the same raw human genius the same intellectual acuity and so whether that genius is placed into
WadeDavis_2008-0034614-0035897 and en route we took darshan from rinpoche and he sat with us and told us about the four noble truths the essence of the buddhist path all life is suffering that doesn't mean all life is negative it means things happen
WadeDavis_2008-0050879-0051588 it's kind of like an andean woodstock sixty thousand indians on pilgrimage to the end of a dirt road that leads to the sacred valley called the
WadeDavis_2008-0069054-0070248 these really are a people who live and breathe the realm of the sacred a baroque religiosity that is simply awesome they consume more coca leaves than any human population half a pound per man per day
WadeDavis_2008-0084366-0085217 will never step outside of the sacred fields that surround the men's hut for all that time until he begins his journey of initiation
WadeDavis_2008-0096141-0097447 and yet still they pray and it's an amazing thing to think that this close to miami two hours from miami there is an entire civilization of people praying every day for your well being
WadeDavis_2008-0108702-0109538 the myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being us they are unique answers to that fundamental question what does it mean to be human and alive
WadeDavis_2012-0008873-0009947 in the northwest quadrant of british columbia an area of land the size of oregon there's one road a narrow ribbon of asphalt that slips up the side of the coast mountains to the yukon
WadeDavis_2012-0024145-0025091 generating hundreds of millions of tons of toxic waste that by the project's design will simply be dumped into the lakes of the sacred headwaters
WadeDavis_2012-0037632-0038558 we need your help and if any of you would like to join us on this great adventure please come and see me later today thank you very much
WaelGhonim_2011X-0010861-0011173 is what i call the psychological barrier of fear
WaelGhonim_2011X-0020698-0020862 in june
WaelGhonim_2011X-0029158-0029366 hey let's have a silent stand
WaelGhonim_2011X-0035245-0035904 this whole page was again managed by the people in fact the anonymous admin
WaelGhonim_2011X-0043862-0044640 seriously with the amount of change i had noticed in this square i thought it was twelve years i never had in my mind
WaelGhonim_2011X-0055583-0055892 actually i had this taxi driver telling me
WayneMcGregor_2012G-0007868-0008981 and that was the very first time that i found an opportunity to feel that i was able to express my own voice and that's what's fueled me then to become a choreographer i feel like i've got something to say and something to share
WayneMcGregor_2012G-0027856-0029551 so i can describe it very simply i can describe it in my arms right so all i did was take my hand and then i move my hand i can describe it whoa in my head you know whoa okay i can do also my shoulder yeah it gives me something to do something to work towards if i were to take that letter t and flatten it down on the floor
WayneMcGregor_2012G-0074115-0075238 if i asked you to reach out you don't have to literally do it but in mind reach out to the top of the e where would you reach if you reach with your finger where would it be if you reach with your elbow where would it be
WillWright_2007-0010071-0011512 so a few years ago i actually started getting very interested in the seti program and that's kind of the way i work is i get interested in different kinds of subjects i dive in i research them and then i try to figure out how to craft a toy around that so that other people can kind of experience the same sense of discovery as i did as i was learning that subject
WillWright_2007-0027106-0027267 and now we might try to
WillWright_2007-0045548-0045627 pose for a photo
WillWright_2007-0060341-0061217 that were brought in you know some of these were created by the player others by other players automatically sent over here but there's a very simple little kind of calculation of what's required how much
WillWright_2007-0076104-0077008 so in fact we're going to have this unlimited number of worlds you can kind of explore here now as we move into the future and we start going out in this space and doing stuff we're drawing a lot from things like science fiction
WillWright_2007-0095130-0095424 basically the reason why i make toys like this is because
WillardWigan_2009G-0007389-0008161 what made me do it at school i will admit this academically i couldn't express myself so i was
WillardWigan_2009G-0021698-0022997 so i did and how i set about that i got some splinters of wood and i sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass constructed this little apartment well it
WillardWigan_2009G-0040920-0040938 i
WillardWigan_2009G-0073238-0073254 and
WillardWigan_2009G-0107403-0107430 the
WilliamKamkwamba_2007G-0012704-0013182 yeah the windmill ca and so and that windmill what it worked
WilliamKamkwamba_2007G-0020577-0020880 and so you're talking to people here at ted to get
WilliamKamkwamba_2009G-0006661-0008067 was a story i wouldn't tell you then but well i'm feeling good right now i would like to share that story today we have seven children in my family all sisters excepting me
WilliamKamkwamba_2009G-0020363-0021159 where i found my materials many people including my mother said i was
WilliamLi_2010-0003668-0003840 so why should we care about blood vessels
WilliamLi_2010-0016828-0017139 a number of diseases there are defects in the system
WilliamLi_2010-0029760-0030385 and virtually one hundred percent of us by the time we reach our seventies will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid
WilliamLi_2010-0041076-0042386 and we can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal healthy vessels we see in other places of the body they're abnormal they're very poorly constructed and because of that they're highly vulnerable to treatments that target
WilliamLi_2010-0051467-0051759 so let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples
WilliamLi_2010-0060779-0061813 when antiangiogenic therapies first became available well you can see that there has been a seventy to one hundred percent improvement in survival for people with kidney cancer multiple myeloma
WilliamLi_2010-0070980-0071855 could boost the body's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers in other words can we eat to starve cancer
WilliamLi_2010-0080710-0080990 and you can see clearly that the teas vary in
WilliamLi_2010-0090065-0090625 well the best example i know is a study of seventy nine thousand men followed over twenty years
WilliamLi_2010-0105513-0106560 this is that we can't take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal mouse's weight is supposed to be in other words we can't create supermodel mice
WilliamMcDonough_2005-0002593-0003276 the canary in the mine wasn't singing and so the question that we might not have birds
WilliamMcDonough_2005-0024277-0025112 for all time and so we start our designs with that question because what we realize today is that modern culture appears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy
WilliamMcDonough_2005-0037101-0037916 the same time we realize that our products are not safe and healthy so we've designed products and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million this is a baby blanket by pendleton that
WilliamMcDonough_2005-0043764-0044529 in a rather terrifying prospect this is a hospital monitor from los angeles sent to china this woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous
WilliamMcDonough_2005-0049986-0050889 where i come from i grew up in hong kong with six million people in forty square miles during the dry season we had four hours of water every fourth day and the relationship to landscape
WilliamMcDonough_2005-0069937-0070266 liberty and the pursuit of happiness
WilliamMcDonough_2005-0082103-0083527 but also the technical one where we take materials and put them into closed cycles we call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition biological nutrition can supply about five hundred million humans
WilliamMcDonough_2005-0098835-0100087 we're developing now protocols for cities that's the home of technical nutrients the country the home of biological and putting them together and so i will finish by showing you a new city we're designing for the chinese government we're doing twelve cities for china
WilliamMcDonough_2005-0111770-0112481 your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants which are sold as assets not liabilities because who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas
WilliamNoel_2012S-0006614-0007491 now codex c is actually buried in this book it's buried treasure because this book is actually a prayer book
WilliamNoel_2012S-0022841-0023685 the first problem was a conservation problem and this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with there was glue on the spine of the book
WilliamNoel_2012S-0037471-0038321 you zoom in and you zoom in and you zoom in and you zoom in and you can just read it now
WilliamNoel_2012S-0051188-0051845 so what did we discover well one of the unique texts in archimedes is called the stomachion
WilliamNoel_2012S-0061307-0062947 consider the spartans they won enumerable victories but no one remembers what they are because they were all fought for selfish ends the one battle that the spartans fought that everybody remembers is the the battle of thermopylae where they were butchered to a man but fought for the freedom of greece
WilliamNoel_2012S-0073826-0075612 at the moment you have to go to the national library of y's site or the university library of x's site which is about the most boring way in which you can deal with digital data what you want to do is to aggregate it all together because the web of the ancient manuscripts of the future isn't going to be built by institutions
WilliamUry_2010X-0007184-0007341 they gave it back to the wise old woman
WilliamUry_2010X-0017613-0018662 it's us who act as the surrounding community around any conflict who can play a constructive role let me give give you
WilliamUry_2010X-0031086-0031662 and as the saying goes when angry you will make the best speech you will ever regret
WilliamUry_2010X-0041723-0042336 question is where's the third side there how can we possibly go to the balcony now i
WilliamUry_2010X-0057084-0057866 in order to create fear what's the opposite of terrorism it's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend
WilliamUry_2010X-0070804-0071476 and we then took a bus and took some walks and went to harran where in the bible he sets off on his journey
WilliamUry_2010X-0076126-0077478 that's the essence of the abraham path but that's what you discover is you go into these villages in the middle east where you expect hostility and you get the most amazing hospitality all associated with abraham in the name of father abraham let me
WilliamUry_2010X-0085380-0085754 in the guardian in the manchester guardian
WilliamUry_2010X-0097476-0098260 what would the oak tree look like well i think back to my childhood a good part of which i spent after being born here in chicago i spent in europe
WilliamUry_2010X-0108880-0109985 the third side is us each of us with a single step can take the world can bring the world a step closer to peace
WillieSmits_2009-0010369-0011210 the largest accumulation of organic material in the world when you open this for growing oil palms you're creating co two volcanoes
WillieSmits_2009-0023557-0024232 bird species as of today we have thirty species of reptiles so what happened here we created a huge
WillieSmits_2009-0035493-0036561 choice and then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out now in this recipe you also have the cost you also know how much labor is needed
WillieSmits_2009-0048920-0049730 in the united states and once the soil gets dried you're in a dry season you get cracks oxygen goes in flames come out and the problem starts all over again
WillieSmits_2009-0061508-0062280 and we were actually monitoring measuring every single tree in these two thousand hectares five thousand acres
WillieSmits_2009-0076284-0077466 and then making sure that at every stage of that upgrowing forest there are crops that can be used in the beginning maybe pineapples and beans and corn in the second phase there will be bananas and papayas later on there will be
WillieSmits_2009-0089656-0090753 so this is the samboja lestari area you measure how the trees grow back but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back and biodiversity is an indicator of how much water
WillieSmits_2009-0102278-0103093 but the real success of course is our band because if a baby is born we will play so everyone's our family and you don't make trouble with your family
WillieSmits_2009-0114664-0115333 it is the cooperative they have a democratic culture there so there you can use the local justice system to protect
WinghamRowan_2012S-0008056-0008755 in reality no recruitment agency wants to handle that sort of business so you are going to muddle by understaffed
WinghamRowan_2012S-0024709-0025066 but only for organizations at the top of the economy
WinghamRowan_2012S-0038023-0038894 these mechanisms these facilities are not in the gift of craigslist or gumtree or yahoo they're controlled by the state
WinghamRowan_2012S-0050569-0051882 so imagine that policymakers outlined a facility let's call it national e markets nems for short think of it as a regulated public utility so it's on a par with the water supply or the road network
WinghamRowan_2012S-0057248-0059095 imagine that there's a concession period defined of maybe fifteen years in which they can take all these benefits and run with them and imagine that the consortia who bid to run it are told whoever comes in at the lowest percentage markup on each transaction to fund the whole thing will get the deal
WinghamRowan_2012S-0065808-0067664 potentially deciding whether to enter the babysitting market and they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and training if they wanted to go into that market they'd have to do assessment interviews with local parents who wanted a pool of babysitters is it worth their while should they be looking at other sectors should they be moving to another part of the country where there's a shortage of babysitters
WolfgangKessling_2012S-0009026-0010482 ambient temperature with thermal comfort we are used to looking at charts like that and you see this red line showing the air temperature in june and july and yes that's right it's picking up to forty five degrees c it's actually very hot
WolfgangKessling_2012S-0028906-0029220 we as human beings we produce heat
WolfgangKessling_2012S-0041898-0043829 floor heating system where water pipes are embedded in the floor and just by using cold water going through the water pipes you can release the heat which is absorbed during the day in the stadium so you can create that comfort and then by adding dry air instead of down chilled air
WolfgangKessling_2012S-0056685-0057060 this is not only useful for stadia we can use that also in open
WoodyNorris_2004-0004151-0004357 and pivoting as it went across the record
WoodyNorris_2004-0009529-0009728 came out of it in every direction
WoodyNorris_2004-0016787-0017093 now after almost eighty years of having sound
WoodyNorris_2004-0027299-0027730 and we're living in a great time right now because almost everything's being explored anew
WoodyNorris_2004-0036111-0036469 so we create silence as much as we create sound
WoodyNorris_2004-0044242-0044692 you turn up the volume just a little bit i'm talking about a little over eighty decibels
WoodyNorris_2004-0049802-0049969 effect happens in the air
WoodyNorris_2004-0059291-0059417 a separate system in the back
WoodyNorris_2004-0065116-0065464 and see a fraction of a degree kelvin in temperature shift
WoodyNorris_2004-0073529-0073774 i just sold that for a million and a half dollars cash
XDRTB_2008-0008855-0008957 from the halls of
YangLan_2011G-0013638-0014861 my generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of china that has made so many changes in the past twenty thirty years
YangLan_2011G-0022904-0024181 offended them but actually they were impressed by my words and so i was in the second round of competition and then the third and the fourth after seven rounds of competition i was the last one to survive it
YangLan_2011G-0045479-0045704 to let the steam out a little bit
YangLan_2011G-0058041-0059104 that ratio in america would only cost a couple five years to earn but in china it's thirty to forty years with the skyrocketing real estate price
YangLan_2011G-0070914-0071148 the gini coefficient
YangLan_2011G-0099164-0100045 how are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth to keep sustainability and stability
YannArthusBertrand_2009-0006156-0006623 i'm going to show you some examples of the last pictures i've done in the last year
YannArthusBertrand_2009-0017562-0018720 very important for the life on earth like al gore told you two billion people live on the water from the glacier of himalaya return of fish men
YannArthusBertrand_2009-0031320-0031711 we have done five thousand interviews i'm going to show
YannArthusBertrand_2009-0046764-0048101 years now of being in a wheelchair i've done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair i still surf i sail the world i freedive after many people said i couldn't do that
YannArthusBertrand_2009-0061713-0062065 raising our children not unlike millions of other species living
YannArthusBertrand_2009-0071130-0071299 we're only trying to improve our lives
YannArthusBertrand_2009-0084589-0085163 let me tell you something it's too late to be
YashengHuang_2011G-0009888-0010247 behind these two pictures is that the chinese government
YashengHuang_2011G-0025160-0026342 if you believe in the infrastructure view then you will say country one must be china they must have done better in terms of economic growth and country two is possibly india
YashengHuang_2011G-0042447-0043867 country b with dollar seven hundred per capita gdp as compared with dollar six hundred and fifty per capita gdp both countries are in asia if i were to ask you which are the two asian countries
YashengHuang_2011G-0056984-0057975 so the east asian model has this massive selection bias it is known as selecting on a dependent variable something we always tell our students to avoid
YashengHuang_2011G-0065648-0066182 is especially sharp between chinese women and indian women
YashengHuang_2011G-0071671-0073543 a huge advantage in life expectancy on average as a chinese in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five you lived ten years more than an average indian so if you have a choice between being a chinese and being an indian you would want to become a chinese in order to live ten years longer
YashengHuang_2011G-0097361-0098722 a little known fact about india in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s is that the country not only has undertaken economic reforms the country has also undertaken political reforms by introducing village self
YoavMedan_2011P-0001632-0002763 the last thirteen years one three thirteen years i've been part of an exceptional team at insightec in israel and partners around the world for taking this idea this concept
YoavMedan_2011P-0013777-0015537 you know all about imaging right ultrasound imaging and you know also about lithotripsy breaking kidney stones but ultrasound can be shaped to be anything in between because it's a mechanical
YoavMedan_2011P-0029574-0030268 john is a retired professor of history from virginia so he suffered from essential tremor for many years
YoavMedan_2011P-0053266-0054172 and this is a quote from john after he wrote it he said miraculous and his wife said this is the happiest moment of my life
YoavMedan_2011P-0069339-0070211 so again this is an immediate relief and you have to understand what those people feel and what their family
YoavMedan_2011P-0088009-0089762 she was diagnosed with a grapefruit sized fibroid this is a big fibroid she was offered a hysterectomy but this is an inconceivable proposition for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option so she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure in two thousand and eight
YoavMedan_2011P-0095231-0096036 the patient holds a stop sonication button he can stop the surgery at any moment and
YochaiBenkler_2005G-0008133-0008958 which led to a stark bifurcation between producers who had to be able to raise financial capital just like any other industrial
YochaiBenkler_2005G-0022857-0023557 happens is radically distributed each of us in these advanced economies has one of these
YochaiBenkler_2005G-0034048-0034965 this so the story that most people know is the story of free or open source software this is market share of apache web server
YochaiBenkler_2005G-0050034-0050633 which is vastly better than what you'll find in the encyclopedia com which is barbie klaus
YochaiBenkler_2005G-0062046-0063254 and tied to each other we're going to count those and count them up and again here you see barbie com but also very quickly adiosbarbie com the body image for every size a contested cultural object
YochaiBenkler_2005G-0078366-0079156 it was too expensive to have decentralized social production to have decentralized action
YochaiBenkler_2005G-0094030-0094789 things that you know what they'll do in advance you begin to build more open tools there's a new set of values a new set of things people value
YochaiBenkler_2005G-0105168-0105828 for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes or for the new model of production
YossiVardi_2007-0003215-0003510 if you are scared by global warming
YossiVardi_2007-0006573-0007073 this is the natural posture of a man sitting squatting for ventilation
YossiVardi_2007-0014551-0014566 a
YossiVardi_2007-0022896-0023603 and this research is being precipitated by the us government so you can see that your tax man is working for good causes
YossiVardi_2007-0030714-0030949 and then our next talk our next
YvesBehar_2008-0007393-0008204 in switzerland so i created this compilation of the two i took my skis and i took a board and i put a mast foot in there and
YvesBehar_2008-0017749-0018542 what i realized then is they didn't really want to change the legacy stuff they didn't want to change the insides they
YvesBehar_2008-0028885-0029616 and just by drawing on a little computer tablet the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want
YvesBehar_2008-0040393-0041265 so jawbone is a project that you're familiar with and it has a humanistic technology it feels your skin
YvesBehar_2008-0053402-0054222 you need a different structure so in a way the different structure is that we're partners it's a partnership we can
YvesBehar_2008-0063553-0064740 at the end of the day what we bring is these values and these values create a soul for the companies we work with and it's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor when others can be creative and do more with it
YvesBehar_2008-0075613-0076698 really happened because of the the passion and the olpc people and the engineers they fought the suppliers they fought the the
YvesBehar_2008-0087089-0087588 some of you might have heard about the new york city condom it's actually
YvesBehar_2008-0101177-0101564 more you can always ask me for some more later

ZachKaplan_2005-0026970-0028139 this is the magnetically levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial the gel that you're holding would be lining the bottom of the board now this is important for two reasons one the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that if it were to hit the rider in the head
ZachKaplan_2005-0039255-0039920 in our brainstorms we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal so at the end of the game you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag

ZahraLanghi_2012X-0029962-0031145 one day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and sufi tombs on another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the american ambassador and the attack on the consulate

ZainabSalbi_2010G-0047538-0048515 of thousands of congolese women are getting raped and mutilated how interesting these just become numbers that we refer to
ZainabSalbi_2010G-0061907-0062879 do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing

ZeFrank_2004-0021058-0021129 of the box
ZeFrank_2004-0030898-0031017 i mean like in the ted sense
ZeFrank_2004-0042088-0042240 oh
ZeFrank_2004-0052140-0052405 i can come back next year
ZeFrank_2004-0061892-0062748 as speakers to get there in the trenches and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience and i've got to say that
ZeFrank_2004-0073529-0073876 i decided to try my hand i came up with a few games
ZeFrank_2004-0084768-0085696 making things you know making things actually does give me a lot of joy it's the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety
ZeFrank_2004-0097624-0098793 so the scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool in other words it's a helping tool you can draw your simple stick figure and then it collaborates with you to create sort of like a post war german etching
ZeFrank_2004-0107836-0108197 if you come home and your spouse or whoever it is
ZeFrank_2010G-0006296-0007197 and people started laying bread in tribute and eventually a team was able to do it between new zealand and spain it's pretty incredible the
ZeFrank_2010G-0018954-0019032 i'm about to
ZeFrank_2010G-0034539-0034745 i heard you were looking for me
ZeFrank_2010G-0044428-0044593 third grade
ZeFrank_2010G-0056651-0057433 even the smallest act of kindness can make me cry like even people in convenience stores saying
ZeFrank_2010G-0061176-0062465 fifty two to forty eight with love was a project around the time of the last election cycle where mccain and obama both in their speeches after the election talked about reconciliation and i was like what the hell does that look like
ZeFrank_2010G-0068156-0069057 like phew it's not him so what i did unfortunately i was harboring all this kind of awful experience and this pain inside of
ZeFrank_2010G-0085877-0087173 know i had one but anyway this same person laura ended up emailing me a little bit after that project and i felt badly for not having done a good job and she said i'm really anxious i just moved to a new town
ZeFrank_2010G-0106885-0106933 thank you
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G-0016338-0017480 our job is to find the hard evidence the fossil evidence to fill in this gap and see the different stages of development because it's only when you do that that you can talk about
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G-0033166-0033823 one of my assistants who never went to school said to me listen zeray you either don't know what you're looking for or you're looking in the wrong place
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G-0044911-0045314 so then once you've done that the next stage is to know what it is
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G-0057541-0058786 what does she tell us to answer this question we can phrase another question what do we actually know about our ancestors we want to know how they looked like how they behaved how they walked around and how they
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G-0070399-0071497 if you were there three point three million years ago to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human maybe you're wondering so you see this
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G-0076651-0078041 and he goes back and reports can you imagine how much biased his report would be that's what somehow we were doing so far in the absence of the fossil children so i think the new fossil fixes this problem
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G-0083934-0084735 so the question is are we up to the challenge and can we really do better than these primitive small brained ancestors
iOTillettWright_2012X-0005336-0006164 we are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves we start forming cliques as soon as we're old enough to know what acceptance feels like
iOTillettWright_2012X-0021371-0022669 if my family though had been the kind of people to believe in therapy they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty but in my particular case i just woke up one day when i was fourteen and i decided that i wanted to be a girl again
iOTillettWright_2012X-0037334-0038686 i loved these people and i admired their freedom but i watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television
iOTillettWright_2012X-0048368-0048543 so i decided to make
iOTillettWright_2012X-0069456-0069671 i know that this is a talk
iOTillettWright_2012X-0085954-0086409 that most people fall on a spectrum of what i have come to refer to as grey
iOTillettWright_2012X-0096777-0097310 aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs
iOTillettWright_2012X-0101489-0101656 and they'll begin to fall away
iOTillettWright_2012X-0106633-0107270 it's too late because i already am all of those things we already are all of those things and we always have
